# Testing and logging strategies

## Overview

Testing and logging are critical components in the lifecycle of multi-agent systems. Effective testing ensures that agents behave as expected under various scenarios, while comprehensive logging provides visibility into their actions, enabling easier debugging, monitoring, and auditing. Together, these strategies help maintain security, reliability, and scalability in complex agent workflows.

## Explanation

### 1. **Testing in Multi-Agent Workflows**

Testing multi-agent systems involves more than just verifying individual components. It requires validating the interactions, communication, and coordination among agents, as well as the integration with external tools and APIs. Key aspects include:

- **Unit Testing:** Isolate and test individual agent functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions among agents and external services.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate real-world workflows and scenarios.
- **Security Testing:** Ensure agents handle sensitive data and tool execution securely.

Automated tests with clear assertions and simulated environments (mocks/stubs) are essential. Given the dynamic nature of multi-agent workflows, tests should cover edge cases such as message loss, out-of-order execution, and failed tool invocations.

### 2. **Logging and Monitoring**

Robust logging provides detailed records of agent activities, decisions, and errors. This is vital for:

- **Debugging:** Trace issues in complex agent interactions.
- **Auditing:** Maintain security and compliance.
- **Monitoring:** Detect anomalies or failures in production.

Logging strategies should:

- Capture context: agent ID, timestamps, actions, tool invocations, and responses.
- Differentiate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG).
- Avoid logging sensitive data.

Centralized log aggregation (using tools like ELK stack, Datadog, or CloudWatch) and real-time monitoring dashboards help maintain operational visibility.

## Examples

### Example 1: **Unit Testing an Agent’s Decision Logic**

```python
import unittest

class TestAgentDecision(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_should_execute_tool(self):
        agent = MyAgent()
        input_data = {"intent": "search", "query": "weather"}
        decision = agent.should_execute_tool(input_data)
        self.assertTrue(decision)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### Example 2: **Mocking Tool Execution in Integration Tests**

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

def test_agent_tool_interaction():
    agent = MyAgent()
    with patch('tools.weather_api.get_weather') as mock_get_weather:
        mock_get_weather.return_value = {"temp": 22, "unit": "C"}
        result = agent.process_request("What's the weather?")
        assert "22°C" in result
```

### Example 3: **Structured Logging for Agent Actions**

```python
import logging
import json

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s'
)

def log_agent_action(agent_id, action, details):
    logging.info(json.dumps({
        "agent_id": agent_id,
        "action": action,
        "details": details
    }))

# Usage
log_agent_action(
    agent_id="agent_123",
    action="tool_invocation",
    details={"tool": "search", "query": "python logging"}
)
```

### Example 4: **Masking Sensitive Data in Logs**

```python
def mask_sensitive(data):
    if 'api_key' in data:
        data['api_key'] = '***REDACTED***'
    return data

def log_tool_execution(agent_id, tool, params):
    safe_params = mask_sensitive(params.copy())
    logging.info(f"Agent {agent_id} invoked {tool} with params {safe_params}")
```

## Best Practices

- **Write layered tests:** Cover unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios.
- **Use mocks and stubs:** Simulate external dependencies and tool outputs.
- **Automate test runs:** Integrate tests with CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation.
- **Implement structured logging:** Use consistent, machine-readable log formats (e.g., JSON).
- **Separate log levels:** Use appropriate logging levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG).
- **Redact sensitive information:** Never log secrets, credentials, or personal data.
- **Centralize logs:** Aggregate logs from all agents for unified monitoring and alerting.
- **Monitor for anomalies:** Set up alerts for unusual agent behaviors or failures.
- **Review logs regularly:** Use logs for periodic audits and debugging.
- **Test for security:** Verify that agents handle tool execution and data securely.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Insufficient test coverage for edge cases and error conditions.
- Logging sensitive data inadvertently.
- Ignoring failures in agent-to-agent or agent-to-tool communication.
- Lack of centralized log management.
- Overlooking security testing for tool and code execution.
