# Error handling in agent orchestration

## Overview

Error handling in agent orchestration refers to the strategies and mechanisms used to detect, manage, and recover from failures or unexpected behaviors in workflows involving multiple collaborating agents. In orchestrated agent systems, errors can arise from various sourcesâ€”such as tool failures, communication breakdowns, invalid inputs, or resource limitations. Robust error handling ensures reliability, security, and maintainability, preventing partial or cascading failures and enabling seamless recovery or human intervention when necessary.

## Explanation

In multi-agent systems, orchestration involves coordinating tasks, data flows, and interactions between agents and external tools or environments. Errors in these workflows can manifest as:

- **Tool execution failures** (e.g., API errors, timeouts)
- **Agent malfunction or crash**
- **Incorrect or unexpected outputs**
- **Resource exhaustion** (e.g., memory, CPU, API quota)
- **Security violations** (e.g., unauthorized code execution)

Effective error handling must address the following:

1. **Detection:** Identify when and where errors occur, often via status codes, exceptions, or abnormal outputs.
2. **Reporting:** Log errors with sufficient context for debugging and auditing.
3. **Recovery:** Attempt to resolve or mitigate the error (retry, fallback, escalate).
4. **Notification:** Inform system operators or users as appropriate when critical errors occur.
5. **Isolation:** Prevent errors from propagating or affecting other agents/workflows.

### Example Error Handling Strategies

- **Try/Except Blocks:** Catch and handle exceptions raised by agent actions or tool invocations.
- **Timeouts and Retries:** Set time limits on operations and retry on transient failures.
- **Validation:** Check agent inputs/outputs for correctness before proceeding.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Use alternative agents or tools if the primary fails.
- **Circuit Breakers:** Temporarily halt requests to failing components to prevent cascading failure.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Error Handling in Agent Workflow

```python
def run_agent_workflow(agent, task):
    try:
        result = agent.execute(task)
        if not validate_result(result):
            raise ValueError("Invalid result from agent")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(f"Error running agent {agent.name}: {str(e)}", context={"task": task})
        notify_operator(agent, task, error=e)
        return None
```

### Example 2: Retry and Fallback

```python
def execute_with_fallback(primary_agent, backup_agent, task, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return primary_agent.execute(task)
        except Exception as e:
            log_warning(f"Attempt {attempt+1}: Primary agent failed: {str(e)}")
    log_info("Falling back to backup agent.")
    try:
        return backup_agent.execute(task)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(f"Backup agent failed: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

### Example 3: Logging and Monitoring

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def log_error(message, context=None):
    logging.error(f"{message} | Context: {context}")

def log_warning(message):
    logging.warning(message)

def log_info(message):
    logging.info(message)
```

## Best Practices

**Key Best Practices:**

- **Centralize error handling:** Use a unified approach for capturing and managing errors across all agents.
- **Implement detailed logging:** Record errors with context, timestamps, and tracebacks.
- **Limit retries:** Set sensible retry limits to avoid infinite loops and resource exhaustion.
- **Validate all agent inputs/outputs:** Prevent propagation of malformed data between agents.
- **Monitor agents and workflows:** Use dashboards and alerts for early detection of recurring issues.
- **Fail fast and isolate:** Quickly halt or isolate failing components to contain errors.
- **Graceful degradation:** Provide fallback mechanisms and degrade functionality gracefully when necessary.
- **Secure tool/code execution:** Sanitize inputs and restrict execution environments to prevent security breaches.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- **Silent failures:** Not logging or surfacing errors, leading to undetected issues.
- **Uncaught exceptions:** Letting exceptions crash the entire workflow.
- **Over-retrying:** Consuming excessive resources by retrying indefinitely.
- **Poor error context:** Insufficient logs make debugging difficult.
- **Inadequate validation:** Allowing bad outputs to propagate and multiply problems.
