# TransformMessages and Message Transforms

## Overview

**TransformMessages** and **message transforms** are advanced techniques for dynamically manipulating, routing, or augmenting messages within an agent's workflow. By intercepting and modifying message flows, agents can achieve richer context management, multimodal processing, and complex conditional behaviors. These tools enable composability, allowing developers to combine multiple capabilities—such as vision, memory, and logic—into a single, cohesive agent.

## Explanation

### What are TransformMessages?

A **TransformMessage** is a design pattern or mechanism that enables an agent to intercept, modify, or supplement the messages it processes. This can include:

- Preprocessing user inputs (e.g., extracting images, parsing commands)
- Injecting additional context (e.g., recent memory, metadata)
- Filtering or reformatting responses before output
- Chaining multiple transforms for complex behaviors

### How do message transforms work?

Message transforms are typically implemented as functions or middleware components. These intercept incoming or outgoing messages, apply custom logic (such as adding context variables or handling multimodal data), and then pass the message along the pipeline.

This approach is especially powerful when combined with:

- **Multimodal and Vision Capabilities:** For handling images, voice, or text in a unified way.
- **Context Variables and Conditional Logic:** For adapting agent behavior based on conversation state.

### Composability

With message transforms, multiple capabilities (e.g., vision, memory, logic) can be composed within a single agent by chaining or stacking transforms. Each transform adds or modifies part of the message, resulting in a flexible and extensible agent architecture.

## Examples

### 1. Basic Message Transform

Suppose you want every user message to be lowercased before processing:

```python
def lowercase_transform(message):
    message['content'] = message['content'].lower()
    return message

agent.add_incoming_transform(lowercase_transform)
```

### 2. Injecting Visual Context

Add image analysis results to the message context if an image is detected:

```python
def vision_transform(message):
    if 'image' in message:
        vision_result = vision_model.analyze(message['image'])
        message['context']['vision'] = vision_result
    return message

agent.add_incoming_transform(vision_transform)
```

### 3. Composing Multiple Capabilities

Chain transforms to handle both vision and memory before agent response:

```python
def memory_transform(message):
    recent_facts = vector_memory.retrieve(message['content'])
    message['context']['memory'] = recent_facts
    return message

agent.add_incoming_transform(vision_transform)
agent.add_incoming_transform(memory_transform)
```

### 4. Conditional Logic with Context Variables

Apply conditional logic to modify agent behavior based on the conversation topic:

```python
def topic_routing_transform(message):
    if message['context'].get('topic') == 'math':
        message['route'] = 'math_agent'
    else:
        message['route'] = 'default_agent'
    return message

agent.add_incoming_transform(topic_routing_transform)
```

## Best Practices

- **Modular Design:** Implement transforms as independent, reusable functions.
- **Order Matters:** Chain transforms thoughtfully—earlier transforms can affect later ones.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle missing or malformed data within transforms.
- **Context Management:** Use context variables to pass information across transforms.
- **Performance:** Avoid heavy computation in transforms unless necessary; cache results when possible.
- **Testing:** Unit test each transform for expected and edge-case inputs.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Overwriting message fields unintentionally
- Failing to check for required context or data
- Creating "transform spaghetti"—too many tightly coupled transforms
- Forgetting to update downstream logic to expect new context variables
