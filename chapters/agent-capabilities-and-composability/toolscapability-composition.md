# ToolsCapability composition

## Overview

**ToolsCapability composition** refers to the design and integration of multiple agent capabilities—such as tool usage, multimodal perception, memory, and context handling—into a single, cohesive agent. This approach allows agents to perform complex tasks by orchestrating different skill sets (or "capabilities"), such as responding to text and vision inputs, utilizing external tools, managing context, and learning from interactions. Composability enables modular, extensible agent architectures that can adapt to diverse use cases and workflows.

## Explanation

Modern AI agents often require more than a single capability to function effectively. For instance, an agent may need to:

- Interpret images (vision capability)
- Answer questions using external APIs or tools (tool capability)
- Remember past interactions (memory/vector memory)
- Adapt responses based on context variables or conditions

**ToolsCapability composition** is the process of combining these capabilities into a unified agent. This is typically achieved through:

1. **Capability Modules**: Individual features (e.g., vision, tools, memory) are implemented as modular components.
2. **Composability Layer**: A mechanism to orchestrate and route requests between capabilities, ensuring they interact coherently.
3. **Context Management**: Using context variables and message transforms to maintain state and pass relevant information between modules.
4. **Teachability**: Integrating vector memory or embeddings to allow agents to "learn" from new information and adapt over time.

### Example Use Cases

- An agent that can answer questions about images by first interpreting the image (vision), then using a search tool (tool), and referencing past answers (memory).
- Workflow agents that can conditionally invoke different tools or APIs based on user intent, with context-aware responses.

## Examples

### 1. Composing Capabilities in Code

Suppose we use a Python-based agent framework supporting capability composition:

```python
from agent_framework import Agent, ToolsCapability, VisionCapability, VectorMemoryCapability, ContextManager

# Define individual capabilities
tools = ToolsCapability(tool_list=[calculator_tool, web_search_tool])
vision = VisionCapability()
memory = VectorMemoryCapability()
context = ContextManager()

# Compose the agent
agent = Agent(
    capabilities=[tools, vision, memory],
    context_manager=context
)
```

### 2. Implementing Teachability with Vector Memory

```python
# Teach the agent new knowledge
agent.memory.store("What is the capital of France?", "Paris")

# Later, the agent can recall this information
response = agent.respond("What's the capital of France?")
print(response)  # Output: "Paris"
```

### 3. Applying Message Transforms for Context Management

```python
def add_user_context(message, context_vars):
    # Example transform: add user's preferred language
    message['language'] = context_vars.get('preferred_language', 'en')
    return message

agent.context_manager.add_transform(add_user_context)
```

### 4. Conditional Logic to Route Requests

```python
def route_request(request):
    if request.type == "image":
        return agent.vision.process(request)
    elif request.type == "calculation":
        return agent.tools.use('calculator', request)
    else:
        return agent.memory.retrieve(request)

agent.route = route_request
```

## Best Practices

- **Modularize Capabilities**: Implement each capability as an independent, reusable module.
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clear input/output interfaces for each capability to facilitate integration.
- **Context Awareness**: Use context variables and message transforms to manage state and personalize agent behavior.
- **Teachability**: Integrate vector memory to enable agents to learn and adapt dynamically.
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Ensure the agent can handle failures or missing capabilities gracefully.
- **Security & Privacy**: Carefully manage sensitive data when composing capabilities, especially with memory modules.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- **Capability Overlap**: Avoid duplicating functionality across capabilities.
- **Context Leakage**: Prevent unintended sharing of sensitive context between capabilities.
- **Complex Routing Logic**: Keep routing and conditional logic maintainable and testable.
