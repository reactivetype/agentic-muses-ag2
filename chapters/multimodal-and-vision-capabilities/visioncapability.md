# VisionCapability

## Overview

**VisionCapability** refers to an agent’s ability to process, generate, and interpret visual information—such as images—by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with multimodal functionalities. This capability enables agents to perform tasks like image generation, image captioning, and the analysis and formatting of multimodal (text + image) messages. Integrating VisionCapability allows agents to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like manner, expanding applications in fields such as accessibility, content moderation, creative generation, and data analysis.

## Explanation

Modern LLMs can be extended beyond text to handle images and other media. **VisionCapability** typically includes two main functionalities:

1. **Image Generation:** Creating new images from text prompts or structured data.
2. **Image Captioning:** Producing textual descriptions of given images.

These capabilities are integrated through structured outputs and tool calling interfaces, enabling agents to systematically generate or interpret images as part of their workflows.

### How VisionCapability Works

- **Input**: The agent receives either text, images, or a combination (multimodal message).
- **Processing**: Using integrated APIs or plugins (such as OpenAI’s vision models or third-party tools), the agent processes the visual content or generates new images.
- **Output**: The agent returns structured multimodal responses—such as a combination of captions and images—formatted for downstream consumption.

#### Example Use Cases

- **Accessibility**: Generating alt-text descriptions for images.
- **Content Creation**: Generating illustrations or diagrams from descriptions.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights from graphs or visualizations.
- **Moderation**: Identifying inappropriate content in images.

## Examples

### 1. Image Generation

```python
# Example: Generating an image from a text prompt using an agent with VisionCapability

prompt = "A futuristic cityscape at sunset, in the style of digital painting."

# Tool calling structure (pseudo-code example)
response = agent.call_tool(
    tool_name="generate_image",
    input={"prompt": prompt, "style": "digital_painting"}
)

# Output: The agent returns a URL or image blob
print(response["image_url"])
```

### 2. Image Captioning

```python
# Example: Generating a caption for a provided image

image_url = "https://example.com/images/cat.jpg"

response = agent.call_tool(
    tool_name="caption_image",
    input={"image_url": image_url}
)

print("Caption:", response["caption"])
# Output: "A tabby cat sitting on a windowsill, looking outside."
```

### 3. Multimodal Message Processing

```python
# Example: Formatting an agent response with both text and images

response = {
    "text": "Here is a chart summarizing the sales data:",
    "image_url": "https://example.com/images/sales_chart.png"
}

# The agent combines structured text and visual output for richer communication
```

## Best Practices

- **Use Structured Outputs:** Always return image data (URLs, base64) and captions in a well-defined structure for downstream systems.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Validate image inputs and handle failures (e.g., missing images, unsupported formats) with clear messages.
- **Optimize for Accessibility:** Provide descriptive alt-text or captions for all images, benefiting users who rely on screen readers.
- **Respect Content Policies:** Filter generated or processed images for inappropriate or harmful content.
- **Format Multimodal Messages Clearly:** Maintain a consistent schema for combining text and visual content (e.g., JSON fields like `text`, `image_url`, `caption`).

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Ignoring image licensing and copyright issues in generated content.
- Overlooking edge cases (e.g., low-quality or ambiguous images).
- Failing to rate-limit image generation to prevent abuse.
