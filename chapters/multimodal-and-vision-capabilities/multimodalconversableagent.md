# MultimodalConversableAgent

## Overview

A **MultimodalConversableAgent** is an advanced conversational agent capable of understanding, generating, and reasoning over both textual and visual (image) data. Unlike traditional text-only agents, these agents can process multimodal messages—such as combining user queries with images—and can perform tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation. They leverage the latest vision models integrated with large language models (LLMs), enabling richer and more practical interactions in agent-based systems.

## Explanation

A MultimodalConversableAgent extends the capabilities of standard LLM-driven agents by:

- **Accepting Multimodal Inputs:** Processing messages that may include both text and images.
- **Generating Multimodal Outputs:** Producing textual responses, generating images from prompts, or annotating/captioning images.
- **Tool Integration:** Calling external tools (e.g., image generation APIs, vision models) as part of the agent workflow.
- **Structured Output Handling:** Formatting responses to seamlessly handle and route multimodal content.

### How It Works

1. **Input Processing:**  
   The agent receives a message containing text, images, or both. Each element is parsed and identified as a `TextMessage`, `ImageMessage`, or similar structure.

2. **Multimodal Reasoning:**  
   The agent uses its internal logic and LLM+vision models to answer questions about images, describe them, or generate new images from textual prompts.

3. **Tool Calling:**  
   For tasks like image generation (e.g., "Draw a cat on a skateboard"), the agent may call an external image generation tool, integrating the result into its reply.

4. **Output Formatting:**  
   The agent packages responses in a structured way, interleaving text and images as needed, e.g., `[TextMessage("Here is the caption:"), ImageMessage(image_bytes)]`.

### Example Use Cases

- **Image Captioning:**  
  User uploads an image and asks, "What is happening in this photo?"
- **Visual Question Answering:**  
  User sends a picture and asks, "How many people are in this image?"
- **Image Generation:**  
  User requests, "Generate an image of a futuristic cityscape at sunset."

## Examples

### 1. Image Captioning

```python
from multimodal_agent import MultimodalConversableAgent, ImageMessage, TextMessage

# Initialize agent
agent = MultimodalConversableAgent()

# User sends an image and a question
user_input = [
    ImageMessage(open("dog_playing.jpg", "rb").read()),
    TextMessage("What is this dog doing?")
]

# Agent processes multimodal input
response = agent.run(user_input)

# Output: [TextMessage("The dog is playing with a red ball in the park.")]
```

---

### 2. Image Generation

```python
from multimodal_agent import MultimodalConversableAgent, TextMessage

agent = MultimodalConversableAgent()

# User requests image generation
user_input = [
    TextMessage("Generate an image of a robot painting a landscape.")
]

response = agent.run(user_input)

# Output: [TextMessage("Here is your image:"), ImageMessage(<image_bytes>)]
```

---

### 3. Multistep Multimodal Conversation

```python
# User: Uploads a photo of a street and asks for a caption
input1 = [ImageMessage(open("busy_street.jpg", "rb").read()), TextMessage("Describe this scene.")]
response1 = agent.run(input1)
# Output: [TextMessage("A bustling city street filled with people and cars.")]

# User: "Now, generate an image of this street at night."
input2 = [TextMessage("Generate an image of this street at night.")]
response2 = agent.run(input2)
# Output: [TextMessage("Here is the nighttime version:"), ImageMessage(<new_image_bytes>)]
```

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Message Formatting:**  
  Always format multimodal messages using structured types (e.g., `TextMessage`, `ImageMessage`) to avoid ambiguity.

- **Clear User Prompts:**  
  When prompting for image generation or captioning, specify details for more accurate results.

- **Tool Integration:**  
  Ensure tools like image generators or captioning models are robust and well-integrated for seamless agent operation.

- **Security and Privacy:**  
  Handle user-uploaded images with care, especially if images may contain sensitive data.

- **Graceful Fallbacks:**  
  Provide informative messages if an image cannot be processed (e.g., unsupported format, corrupt file).

- **Efficient Resource Management:**  
  Dispose of large image data after use to avoid memory leaks.
