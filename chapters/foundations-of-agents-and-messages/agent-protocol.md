# Agent protocol

## Overview

An **agent protocol** defines the standardized rules and interfaces by which autonomous software agents communicate, coordinate, and interact within a system. It specifies how agents send and receive messages, process events, and maintain consistent interactionsâ€”allowing for scalable, modular, and flexible software architectures. Agent protocols are foundational in multi-agent systems, distributed computing, and modern AI frameworks.

## Explanation

At its core, the agent protocol dictates **how agents interact**:

- **Message Structure**: Defines how information is packaged for communication.
- **Agent Classes**: Different types of agents (e.g., reactive, proactive, hybrid) may implement the protocol differently.
- **Event Handling**: Outlines how agents respond to internal or external events.

### Agents

An **agent** is an autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking actions to achieve goals. In Python, an agent is often modeled as a class with methods for handling messages and events.

### Messages

Messages are structured data objects exchanged between agents. Each message usually includes:

- **Sender**: The agent initiating communication.
- **Receiver**: The intended recipient agent.
- **Type**: The kind of message (e.g., request, response, inform).
- **Payload**: The content or data being communicated.

### Events

An **event** represents a significant change or occurrence in the system (e.g., a timer fires, a resource state changes). Agents are typically designed to handle events either synchronously or asynchronously.

### Agent Protocol Interface

A typical agent protocol provides:

- Methods for sending/receiving messages
- Event handling mechanisms
- Lifecycle management (start, stop, etc.)

#### Example Protocol in Python (Pseudo-code):

```python
class AgentProtocol:
    def send(self, message):
        """Send a message to another agent"""
        pass

    def receive(self):
        """Receive a message from another agent"""
        pass

    def handle_event(self, event):
        """Process an incoming event"""
        pass
```

## Examples

### 1. Defining a Simple Agent and Message

```python
class Message:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver, msg_type, payload):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.msg_type = msg_type
        self.payload = payload

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def send(self, message, agent_registry):
        receiver_agent = agent_registry[message.receiver]
        receiver_agent.receive(message)

    def receive(self, message):
        print(f"{self.name} received {message.msg_type} from {message.sender}: {message.payload}")

# Example usage:
agent_registry = {}
agent_a = Agent("AgentA")
agent_b = Agent("AgentB")
agent_registry["AgentA"] = agent_a
agent_registry["AgentB"] = agent_b

msg = Message(sender="AgentA", receiver="AgentB", msg_type="inform", payload={"data": 42})
agent_a.send(msg, agent_registry)
```

### 2. Handling Events

```python
class Event:
    def __init__(self, name, data):
        self.name = name
        self.data = data

class EventDrivenAgent(Agent):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        print(f"{self.name} processing event: {event.name} with data {event.data}")

# Example event handling
event = Event(name="timeout", data={"duration": 5})
event_agent = EventDrivenAgent("TimerAgent")
event_agent.handle_event(event)
```

### 3. Different Agent Classes

```python
class ReactiveAgent(Agent):
    def receive(self, message):
        print(f"{self.name} reacts immediately to: {message.msg_type}")

class ProactiveAgent(Agent):
    def plan(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is planning ahead.")

# Instantiate and use
reactive = ReactiveAgent("Reactive")
proactive = ProactiveAgent("Proactive")
reactive.receive(msg)
proactive.plan()
```

## Best Practices

- **Clearly define message and event structures**: Use consistent formats for all communications.
- **Encapsulate protocol logic**: Implement protocol handling in a dedicated class or module.
- **Use meaningful message types**: Helps agents understand intent and context.
- **Handle unknown messages/events gracefully**: Avoid crashes on unexpected input.
- **Separate agent logic from protocol specifics**: Promotes modularity and reuse.
- **Document agent interfaces and communication patterns**: Eases maintenance and collaboration.

### Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring error handling in message delivery.
- Tight coupling between agents and protocol implementation.
- Hardcoding agent names or addresses.
- Failing to validate message payloads.
