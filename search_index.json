This section guides you through installing the core package, configuring dependencies, and verifying your setup, ensuring you are ready to build, configure, and run agent-based applications using the framework's abstractions like ConversableAgent, Tool, GroupChat, and LLMConfig.\n\n  explanation: |\n    The project supports flexible agentic communication, tool integration, group orchestration, and LLM management. To unlock these capabilities, you need to install the core package and configure any required dependencies (e.g., LLM provider access, API keys, and optional toolkits).

This modular design enables flexible interaction between agents (human or AI), integration of callable tools, support for multi-agent group conversations, and seamless interoperability with various LLM providers and external tool ecosystems.\n\n  explanation: |\n    The system's architecture centers on the concept of \"agents\"â€”autonomous entities capable of sending and receiving messages, executing tools, and participating in simple or complex group conversations. Agents are implemented through the `ConversableAgent` abstraction, which defines the fundamental agent interface and lifecycle. This is complemented by protocols that formalize agent behaviors, including tool usage and specialized communication patterns.\n\n    Tools and toolkits encapsulate callable functions that agents can propose or execute, leveraging function-calling LLMs and human inputs. The toolkit abstraction allows for easy grouping and management of related tools.\n\n    For orchestrating multi-agent exchanges, the framework introduces group chat and management patterns. These abstractions structure group conversations, control agent turn-taking, and support sophisticated handoff and transition logic.\n\n    LLM configuration is standardized via the `LLMConfig` and `LLMConfigEntry` system, providing robust management of model/provider settings, environment integration, and runtime context control.\n\n    Finally, the architecture supports tool interoperability, enabling the use of tools from other ecosystems (such as LangChain or CrewAI) by converting them into the framework's native Tool abstraction.\n\n  examples:\n    - title: \"Creating a Conversable Agent and Registering a Tool\"\n      description: \"Define an agent, register a function as a tool, and initiate a chat.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\n            name=\"assistant\",\n            system_message=\"You are a helpful AI.\",\n            llm_config={...}\n        )\n\n        @agent.register_for_llm()\n        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            return a + b\n\n        result = agent.initiate_chat(other_agent, message=\"Hello!\")\n\n    - title: \"Defining and Registering a Toolkit\"\n      description: \"Use the @tool decorator and a Toolkit to organize multiple tools and make them available to an agent.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.tools import tool, Toolkit\n\n        @tool(name=\"add\", description=\"Add two numbers\")\n        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            return a + b\n\n        @tool(name=\"subtract\", description=\"Subtract two numbers\")\n        def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            return a - b\n\n        toolkit = Toolkit([add, subtract])\n        toolkit.register_for_llm(agent)\n\n    - title: \"Setting Up a Group Chat with Orchestration Pattern\"\n      description: \"Create a group chat with multiple agents and a round-robin orchestration pattern.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen import GroupChat, GroupChatManager, ConversableAgent\n        from autogen.agentchat.group.patterns.round_robin import RoundRobinPattern\n\n        agents = [ConversableAgent(\"alice\"), ConversableAgent(\"bob\")]\n        pattern = RoundRobinPattern(agents=agents)\n        groupchat, manager = pattern.prepare_group_chat(max_rounds=5, messages=[{\"content\": \"Start chat\"}])\n\n        agents[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=\"Hello group!\")\n\n    - title: \"Configuring an LLM Provider\"\n      description: \"Set up an agent with a provider-specific LLM configuration.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.oai.client import OpenAILLMConfigEntry\n        from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n        entry = OpenAILLMConfigEntry(model=\"gpt-4\", api_key=\"sk-...\")\n        config = LLMConfig([entry])\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\"assistant\", llm_config=config)\n\n    - title: \"Interoperating with External Tool Ecosystems\"\n      description: \"Convert a LangChain tool into a native Tool and register it with an agent.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.tools.interop import Interoperability\n        from langchain.tools import BaseTool\n\n        lc_tool = BaseTool(...)\n        native_tool = Interoperability.convert_tool(lc_tool)\n        agent.register_tool(native_tool)\n\n  best_practices:\n    - \"Assign a unique name to every agent to prevent clashes in multi-agent scenarios.\"\n    - \"Register all tools and toolkits before starting conversations to guarantee their availability.\"\n    - \"Prefer the @tool decorator for defining tools, and use accurate descriptions and type hints.\"\n    - \"Use orchestration patterns (e.g., AutoPattern, RoundRobinPattern) to manage group chat logic instead of manual agent control.\"\n    - \"Manage agent and group chat history thoughtfully to avoid unnecessary memory consumption.\"\n    - \"Utilize LLMConfig context management (with LLMConfig.current(...)) for temporary or global model configuration changes.\"\n    - \"When interoperating with external tools, always use provided converters and registries to ensure compatibility.\"\n    - \"Avoid hardcoding secrets;

Agents represent autonomous entities capable of sending and receiving messages, executing tools, and collaborating in both simple one-on-one and complex multi-agent group chats. Conversations refer to the structured interactions between these agents, often managed and orchestrated through group chat patterns and managers.\n  explanation: |\n    An Agent is an abstraction for any entity (human, AI, or system) that can participate in a conversation. The core agent type, ConversableAgent, provides built-in capabilities for managing chat history, sending/receiving messages, auto-replying, and registering tools (callable functions that the agent can invoke via LLMs). Specialized agent types (like AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, and GroupChatManager) extend this core logic to support various roles and workflows.\nConversations are initiated when agents exchange messages. In the simplest case, two agents (e.g., a user and an assistant) interact directly. For more complex scenarios, the **GroupChat** abstraction allows multiple agents to participate in structured group conversations, orchestrated by a `GroupChatManager` according to flexible \"patterns\" (such as round-robin, LLM-based, or manual speaker selection). Tools and toolkits can be registered with agents, enabling them to perform actions or computations during a conversation.\n\nThe framework abstracts away the complexity of agent orchestration, message routing, and group transitions, allowing developers to focus on high-level conversational logic and collaborative workflows. At its core, every agent implements a protocol (interface) for communication, ensuring composability and extensibility.\n  examples:\n- title: \"Setting Up a Simple Agent Conversation\"\n  description: \"Create two agents and initiate a chat between them.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n    assistant = ConversableAgent(\n        name=\"assistant\",\n        system_message=\"You are a helpful AI.\",\n        llm_config={...}\n    )\n    user = ConversableAgent(name=\"user\")\n\n    assistant.initiate_chat(user, message=\"Hello!

This includes selecting providers (e.g., OpenAI, Azure, Gemini), defining model parameters, handling authentication, and orchestrating model usage across agents and groups. Robust LLM configuration ensures agents can communicate effectively, leverage advanced features such as tool calling, and operate securely in multi-agent or multi-provider environments.\n  explanation: |\n    Configuring an LLM involves more than just providing an API key and model name. The framework introduces the `LLMConfig` and `LLMConfigEntry` abstractions to standardize configuration for all supported LLM providers. This design enables agents, toolkits, and group orchestrations to interact with LLMs in a provider-agnostic way, supporting serialization, filtering, context management, and extensibility.\n\n    - **LLMConfig**: Represents a collection of `LLMConfigEntry` objects, each specifying the configuration for a single model/provider. It supports loading from JSON files, environment variables, or direct instantiation, and provides filtering and context management for advanced use cases.\n    - **LLMConfigEntry**: An abstract base class for individual model configurations (e.g., model name, API key, endpoint). Each provider (such as OpenAI, Azure, Gemini) has its own subclass with required fields.\n    - **Context Management**: Using `LLMConfig.current(...)` as a context manager allows for temporary overriding of the active configuration, useful in multi-threaded or multi-agent scenarios.\n\n    Agents, such as those inheriting from `ConversableAgent`, are initialized with an `llm_config` parameter. This ensures that all agent operations, including tool-calling and message generation, are governed by the specified model configuration. Advanced usage includes filtering configurations for specific models or capabilities, and leveraging environment-based loading for secure and scalable deployments.\n\n    Proper LLM configuration is essential for:\n    - Ensuring consistent, secure, and reproducible agent behavior.\n    - Switching between providers or models without code changes.\n    - Supporting advanced features like function-calling, chat history management, and group orchestration.\n  examples:\n    - title: \"Basic Agent Setup with LLMConfig\"\n      description: \"Initialize a ConversableAgent with an LLM configuration loaded from environment variables.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n        # Load configuration from an environment variable (e.g., OAI_CONFIG_LIST)\n        config = LLMConfig.from_json(env=\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\")\n\n        # Create an agent with the loaded config\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\n            name=\"assistant\",\n            system_message=\"You are a helpful AI.\",\n            llm_config=config\n        )\n    - title: \"Provider-Specific Configuration\"\n      description: \"Directly specify an OpenAI model and API key using OpenAILLMConfigEntry.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.oai.client import OpenAILLMConfigEntry\n        from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n        entry = OpenAILLMConfigEntry(\n            model=\"gpt-4\",\n            api_key=\"sk-...\",\n            organization=\"org-...\"\n        )\n        config = LLMConfig([entry])\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\"openai_agent\", llm_config=config)\n    - title: \"Context Management for Temporary LLMConfig\"\n      description: \"Temporarily override the global LLM configuration within a code block.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig\n\n        config = LLMConfig.from_json(env=\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\")\n        with LLMConfig.current(config):\n            # All agents created here will use 'config' unless specifically overridden\n            ...\n    - title: \"Filtering LLMConfig for a Specific Model\"\n      description: \"Select only GPT-4 entries from a multi-provider configuration list.\"\n      code: |\n        config = LLMConfig.from_json(env=\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\")\n        gpt4_config = config.where(model=\"gpt-4\")\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\"gpt4_agent\", llm_config=gpt4_config)\n  best_practices:\n    - \"Always use provider-specific LLMConfigEntry subclasses for correct field validation.\"\n    - \"Load configurations from secure sources (environment variables, secrets managers), not hardcoded values.\"\n    - \"Use `LLMConfig.from_json` or `from_env` for scalable, environment-driven deployments.\"\n    - \"Filter LLMConfig with `.where()` to target specific models or providers for agents.\"\n    - \"Leverage context management (`with LLMConfig.current(...)`) for temporary changes, especially in testing or multi-agent workflows.\"\n    - \"Avoid passing raw dictionaries as `llm_config`; always use LLMConfig for consistency and validation.\"\n  related_concepts:\n    - name: \"ConversableAgent (and Agent Protocols)\"\n      description: \"Agents require `llm_config` to communicate with LLMs and perform message generation and tool-calling.\"\n    - name: \"Tool and Toolkit\"\n      description: \"LLM configuration affects which tools can be invoked by the agent, especially for function-calling models.\"\n    - name: \"GroupChat and Group Patterns\"\n      description: \"Group chat orchestration may require consistent or per-agent LLMConfig for coordinated conversations.\"\n    - name: \"LLMConfigEntry\"\n      description: \"Represents individual model/provider configurations used within LLMConfig.\"\n    - name: \"Context Management\"\n      description: \"Contextual configuration enables safe overrides and multi-threaded agent scenarios.\"\n\n"},"chapters/core-concepts/tools-and-toolkit.html":{"url":"chapters/core-concepts/tools-and-toolkit.html","title":"Tools and Toolkit","keywords":"","body":"content:\n  overview: |\n    Tools and toolkits are foundational abstractions in agentic frameworks that enable agents to perform actions beyond conversation. By registering tools (callable functions or APIs) with agents, you empower them to execute code, call external services, or use structured function-calling capabilities in LLMs. Toolkits group related tools for modular and scalable management. Dependency injection ensures that tools receive the correct context or resources when executed, supporting clean separation of concerns and extensibility.\n  explanation: |\n    In an agent framework, a \"tool\" is a callable object (typically a function) that an agent can invokeâ€”either directly or via language model (LLM) function-callingâ€”to perform a task. Tools can range from simple mathematical operations to complex API calls or workflow triggers.\nAgents, such as those derived from `ConversableAgent`, use tools to extend their capabilities beyond pure language processing. Tools must be registered with an agent for the agent (and the underlying LLM) to recognize and propose their use. This is typically done via decorators (e.g., `@tool`), direct registration (e.g., `register_tool`), or via a `Toolkit`â€”a container for managing multiple tools as a unit.\n\nTool registration associates metadata (name, description, parameter schema) with a callable, making it discoverable and usable by both the agent and function-calling LLMs. Registration also supports execution routing, so an agent can both propose and directly execute tools as needed.\n\nDependency injection allows for advanced tool scenarios, where tools can automatically receive required context (e.g., the calling agent, the message context, or other dependencies) without manual wiring. This enables tools to remain decoupled and reusable.\n\nToolkits are collections of related tools, providing batch registration and collective management. They foster modularity, allowing you to assemble and share sets of capabilities across agents or projects.\n\nProperly describing and registering tools, and using dependency injection judiciously, ensures that agents can reliably reason about and use available capabilities. This unlocks powerful patterns for agentic reasoning, automation, and interoperability with external tool ecosystems.\n  examples:\n- title: \"Defining and Registering a Tool with an Agent\"\n  description: \"Use the `@tool` decorator to create a tool and register it for LLM function-calling.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.tools import tool\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n    @tool(name=\"add\", description=\"Add two numbers\")\n    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a + b\n\n    agent = ConversableAgent(\"math_agent\")\n    agent.register_for_llm()(add)  # Register for LLM function-calling\n\n- title: \"Using a Toolkit to Group and Register Tools\"\n  description: \"Bundle multiple tools into a toolkit and register them with an agent.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.tools import tool, Toolkit\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n    @tool(name=\"subtract\", description=\"Subtract two numbers\")\n    def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a - b\n\n    @tool(name=\"multiply\", description=\"Multiply two numbers\")\n    def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a * b\n\n    toolkit = Toolkit([subtract, multiply])\n\n    agent = ConversableAgent(\"calculator\")\n    toolkit.register_for_llm(agent)  # Register all tools for LLM use\n\n- title: \"Registering a Tool for Execution or Dual Use\"\n  description: \"Control whether a tool is available for LLM proposal, execution, or both.\"\n  code: |\n    agent.register_for_execution()(add)     # Only for execution (not LLM proposal)\n    agent.register_tool(add)                # Both propose (LLM) and execute\n\n- title: \"Dependency Injection in Tool Functions\"\n  description: \"Inject agent or context into tools, enabling advanced behaviors.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.tools import tool\n\n    @tool\n    def greet(name: str, agent=None):\n        return f\"Hello, {name}!

Core aspects include automatic function schema generation (for parameter validation and tool descriptions) and robust function parameter management. These utilities ensure seamless agent-tool integration, safe execution, and compatibility with function-calling LLMs.\n  explanation: |\n    In agent-based systems, functions are often exposed as \"tools\" that agents (and LLMs) can call during conversations. To facilitate this, the system must generate a machine-readable \"schema\" for each functionâ€”describing its name, description, expected parameters (types, defaults), and return type. This schema is used for validation, tool registration, and LLM prompt generation (e.g., for OpenAI's function-calling API).\nThe function utilities abstraction automates:\n  - Parsing function signatures (using type hints and docstrings)\n  - Serializing parameter schemas (to JSON Schema, OpenAPI, or other formats)\n  - Handling optional/required parameters, defaults, and nested models (e.g., via Pydantic)\n  - Registering functions as tools, associating metadata and schemas\n  - Validating and converting inputs at call time\n\nThese utilities underpin the \"Tool\" abstraction, ensuring that tools are described accurately and consistently, and that agents can reliably propose, validate, and execute tool calls.

These patterns abstract away the complexities of speaker selection, message routing, handoffs, and conversational flow management, making it easier to build robust multi-agent workflows.\n  explanation: |\n    In multi-agent systems, orchestrating group conversations is non-trivial. Effective group chat requires managing which agent speaks next, how information is passed, and when control transitions between agents. Group Chat Patterns encapsulate these orchestration strategies, allowing developers to focus on high-level workflows rather than low-level agent control.\nThe core abstractions include:\n\n- **ConversableAgent and Agent Protocols**: These form the backbone for all agent communication. Agents can send and receive messages, register tools, and maintain chat history. In group settings, each agent participates as a member of the group chat.\n- **GroupChat**: Represents the state and membership of the group conversation, including a list of agents, the message history, and parameters such as the maximum number of rounds.\n- **GroupChatManager**: Acts as the conductor, managing the flow of the conversation, speaker selection, and the application of orchestration patterns.\n- **Patterns**: Reusable strategies that dictate how agents take turns, how transitions are handled, and how handoffs occur. Examples include round-robin, LLM-based selection (AutoPattern), manual, and random.\n- **Transitions and Handoffs**: Mechanisms for context-sensitive agent switching, allowing for dynamic, condition-based control transfer.\n\nBy leveraging these abstractions and patterns, developers can implement complex collaborative behaviors (e.g., brainstorming, debate, workflow handoffs) with minimal boilerplate and maximum flexibility.

They empower agents to be extended with new skills (capabilities) such as memory, vision, tool usage, and transformation pipelines, and to compose these modularly for complex behaviors. This approach enables flexible, reusable, and scalable agent designs, where agents can dynamically acquire, combine, and orchestrate diverse abilities in various task and group settings.\n\n  explanation: |\n    In advanced agent frameworks, \"capabilities\" refer to pluggable functionalities that enhance an agent's intelligence and interaction. These include memory (tracking context/history), perception (e.g., vision modules for images), tool usage (external functions/APIs), and transforms (pre/post-processing of data or messages). \"Composability\" describes the agent's ability to combine these capabilitiesâ€”either by direct registration, delegation to group managers, or protocol-driven integrationâ€”allowing for highly adaptive and task-specific behaviors.\n\n    The framework achieves this via well-defined abstractions:\n      - **ConversableAgent and Agent Protocols**: Establish the standard interface for agent communication and behavior, providing hooks for registering capabilities and tools.\n      - **Tool and Toolkit**: Formalize callable functions/APIs as tools, which agents can use or propose in conversation, with robust type and metadata support.\n      - **GroupChat and Orchestration Patterns**: Enable multi-agent interactions, role transitions, and group workflows, where composability allows agents with different or overlapping capabilities to collaborate.\n      -

In an agentic AI framework, RAG is implemented by integrating agents with vector databases and document agents, enabling dynamic search, retrieval, and synthesis of relevant information during conversations.\n\n  explanation: |\n    Traditional LLMs generate responses solely based on their trained knowledge, which may be outdated or incomplete. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by allowing LLMs to access and incorporate information retrieved from external sourcesâ€”such as indexed documents, knowledge bases, or vector databasesâ€”at generation time.\n\n    In agent-based frameworks, RAG is achieved by:\n      - Registering retrieval tools (functions that query vector databases or search corpora) with ConversableAgent or specialized document agents.\n      - Using these tools within the LLM's function-calling interface, so the model can proactively fetch and ground its answers on real data.\n      - Employing multi-agent patterns, where one agent specializes in retrieval (DocumentAgent), another in synthesis, and orchestration is managed via GroupChat or GroupChatManager.\n\n    Vector database integrations (e.g., with FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate) are central to RAG, as they enable fast, semantic similarity search over large collections of text or documents. Tools encapsulate these retrieval operations and expose them to the agent layer. Document agents are preconfigured ConversableAgent subclasses or wrappers designed to handle document ingestion, embedding, and retrieval workflows, abstracting the low-level vector store logic.\n\n    RAG workflows typically involve:\n      1. User query: An agent receives a question.\n      2. Retrieval: The agent uses a registered retrieval tool to search the vector DB for relevant passages.\n      3. Synthesis: The agent (or a dedicated synthesizer agent) combines the retrieved snippets with LLM reasoning to produce a grounded response.\n\n    This modular approach allows for flexible, updatable, and auditable agentic systems capable of leveraging both LLM reasoning and external knowledge.\n\n  examples:\n    - title: \"Basic RAG with ConversableAgent and Vector DB\"\n      description: \"Using a retrieval tool that queries a vector database, registered with a ConversableAgent.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent\n        from autogen.tools import tool\n\n        # Assume you have a vector DB client (e.g., FAISS, Chroma)\n        vector_db = ...  # Initialized vector DB client\n\n        @tool(name=\"retrieve_docs\", description=\"Retrieve relevant documents from the vector DB\")\n        def retrieve_docs(query: str, top_k: int = 3):\n            # Returns the top_k most similar documents\n            return vector_db.search(query, top_k=top_k)\n\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\n            name=\"rag_agent\",\n            system_message=\"You are a helpful AI assistant with access to a document database.\",\n            llm_config={...}\n        )\n        agent.register_tool(retrieve_docs)\n\n        # Now, when the agent is prompted, LLM can choose to call retrieve_docs\n        response = agent.initiate_chat(\n            user_proxy,\n            message=\"What does the latest company policy say about remote work?\"\n        )\n\n    - title: \"DocumentAgent for End-to-End RAG\"\n      description: \"Using a specialized DocumentAgent to manage document ingestion, embedding, and retrieval.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.agentchat.document_agent import DocumentAgent\n\n        doc_agent = DocumentAgent(\n            name=\"doc_agent\",\n            vector_db_config={\n                \"provider\": \"chroma\",\n                \"persist_dir\": \"./db\",\n                # Other DB-specific config\n            },\n            llm_config={...}\n        )\n\n        # Add documents to the agent's vector DB\n        doc_agent.ingest_documents([\n            {\"title\": \"Policy\", \"content\": \"Remote work is allowed up to 3 days per week ...\"},\n            # more documents\n        ])\n\n        # User query triggers retrieval and synthesis\n        answer = doc_agent.initiate_chat(\n            user_proxy,\n            message=\"What are the companyâ€™s remote work rules?\"\n        )\n\n    - title: \"Group Pattern: Retrieval and Synthesis Agents\"\n      description: \"Orchestrating a pipeline where one agent retrieves, and another synthesizes the final answer.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen import GroupChat, GroupChatManager, ConversableAgent\n        from autogen.agentchat.document_agent import DocumentAgent\n        from autogen.agentchat.group.patterns.auto import AutoPattern\n\n        retriever = DocumentAgent(name=\"retriever\", vector_db_config={...}, llm_config={...})\n        synthesizer = ConversableAgent(name=\"synthesizer\", system_message=\"Summarize the retrieved docs.\", llm_config={...})\n\n        agents = [retriever, synthesizer]\n        pattern = AutoPattern(initial_agent=retriever, agents=agents)\n        groupchat, manager = pattern.prepare_group_chat(max_rounds=3, messages=[{\"content\": \"Find info on remote work policy.\"}])\n\n        # Start the chat\n        retriever.initiate_chat(manager, message=\"User asked: What is the remote work policy?\")\n\n  best_practices:\n    - \"Always provide clear tool descriptions and parameter schemas to ensure LLMs call retrieval tools correctly.\"\n    - \"Preprocess and chunk documents appropriately for optimal retrieval qualityâ€”avoid excessively large or small chunks.\"\n    - \"Test retrieval accuracy and tune embedding/model configs for your domain.\"\n    - \"Monitor and log retrieval results to audit LLM responses and ensure proper grounding.\"\n    - \"Keep retrieval and synthesis steps modularâ€”use group patterns for complex workflows.\"\n    - \"Manage vector DB storage and memory to avoid bloat, especially in multi-user or multi-session settings.\"\n    - \"Use dedicated document agents for scalable or production RAG systems.\"\n\n  related_concepts:\n    - name: \"Tool and Toolkit\"\n      description: \"Retrieval functions are registered as tools, enabling LLM function-calling for RAG.

This capability ensures that agents can use a unified tool abstraction, regardless of the original source or format of the tool, thus promoting code reuse and seamless integration across different libraries and communities.\n\n  explanation: |\n    The agent framework provides a structured approach to tool interoperability, making it possible to import, convert, and utilize tools from various external sources as first-class citizens in agent conversations. This is achieved through a combination of protocols, registries, and conversion utilities:\n\n    - **Interoperable Protocol:** Any external tool or toolkit can be made interoperable by adhering to a protocol that defines a `convert_tool()` method. This method is responsible for transforming the external tool into a standard AG2 `Tool` object with the required metadata (name, description, parameter schema, etc.).\n    - **InteroperableRegistry:** The registry maintains a mapping of supported external tool types and their corresponding converters. New external tool types can be registered, enabling extensibility as new ecosystems emerge.\n    - **Interoperability Facade:** The main interface (often `Interoperability.convert()`) detects the tool's origin, consults the registry, and applies the correct conversion logic, returning a usable `Tool` or `Toolkit` for agents.\n\n    This design abstracts away ecosystem-specific details, letting you register and use tools from different frameworks exactly as you would native tools. For example, you can import a LangChain tool or a CrewAI tool, convert it, and register it with your agent, making it available for LLM function-calling or direct invocation.\n\n    Common conversion points include:\n      - Wrapping LangChain's `Tool` or `Toolkit` objects for AG2 agent usage\n      - Translating CrewAI tool schemas into the AG2 tool format\n      - Converting Pydantic-AI functions or models into AG2 tools\n\n    This approach ensures that your agent ecosystem stays flexible and future-proof, able to incorporate innovations and capabilities from the broader AI tooling community.\n\n  examples:\n    - title: \"Importing and Converting a LangChain Tool\"\n      description: \"Convert a LangChain tool to an AG2 Tool and register it with an agent.\"\n      code: |\n        from langchain.tools import Tool as LangChainTool\n        from autogen.tools.interoperability import Interoperability\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n        # Assume you have a LangChain tool\n        def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            return a * b\n        lc_tool = LangChainTool(\n            name=\"Multiply\",\n            func=multiply,\n            description=\"Multiply two numbers\"\n        )\n\n        # Convert LangChain tool to AG2 Tool\n        ag2_tool = Interoperability.convert(lc_tool)\n\n        # Register with agent\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\"assistant\", llm_config={...})\n        agent.register_tool(ag2_tool)\n    - title: \"Batch Conversion: CrewAI Toolkit\"\n      description: \"Convert all tools in a CrewAI toolkit and register as a group with an agent.\"\n      code: |\n        from crewai.tools import Toolkit as CrewAIToolkit\n        from autogen.tools.interoperability import Interoperability\n        from autogen.tools import Toolkit\n\n        # CrewAI toolkit with several tools\n        crewai_toolkit = CrewAIToolkit([...])\n\n        # Convert CrewAI toolkit to AG2 Toolkit\n        ag2_toolkit = Interoperability.convert(crewai_toolkit)\n\n        # Register all tools for agent LLM access\n        ag2_toolkit.register_for_llm(agent)\n    - title: \"Custom Converter Registration\"\n      description: \"Support a new external tool type by registering a custom converter.\"\n      code: |\n        from my_external_lib import MySpecialTool\n        from autogen.tools.interoperability import InteroperableRegistry\n\n        class MySpecialToolConverter:\n            @staticmethod\n            def convert_tool(obj):\n                # Custom logic to wrap MySpecialTool as AG2 Tool\n                return Tool(\n                    name=obj.display_name,\n                    description=obj.summary,\n                    function=obj.callable,\n                    parameter_schema=obj.schema\n                )\n\n        # Register custom converter for MySpecialTool\n        InteroperableRegistry.register(MySpecialTool, MySpecialToolConverter)\n\n        # Now convertible via Interoperability.convert()\n        ag2_tool = Interoperability.convert(my_special_tool_instance)\n\n  best_practices:\n    - \"Always provide accurate metadata (name, description, type hints) in your external tools to ensure seamless conversion.\"\n    - \"Prefer using the official Interoperability facade instead of writing ad-hoc conversion code.\"\n    - \"Test converted tools individually before deploying them in multi-agent or production settings.\"\n    - \"Be mindful of parameter schema differences between ecosystems;

This capability allows agents to solve tasks programmatically, execute user-defined or system-provided functions (\"tools\"), and interact safely with the outside world. Execution environments can be locally sandboxed, remote, or even cloud-based, and must be managed to ensure security, reproducibility, and efficiency.\n  explanation: |\n    In an agentic system, \"code execution\" refers to the agent's ability to run codeâ€”either generated by an LLM or pre-registered as a callable toolâ€”during a conversation or workflow. This is achieved via abstractions that wrap functions as \"Tools,\" which are then registered with agent instances (like ConversableAgent). When a user or another agent issues a command or request, the agent can resolve the request to a specific tool, call it with the appropriate arguments, and return the result in the ongoing conversation.\nThe execution environment determines where and how this code runs. By default, Python functions/tools run in the agentâ€™s local environment, but advanced settings may use containerized, remote, or polyglot backends to isolate or scale execution. Managing execution environments involves controlling resource usage, handling security concerns (e.g., code injection risks), and tracking execution context (such as variable scope, working directory, or even session state).\n\nKey abstractions and patterns:\n  - **ConversableAgent** is the core agent type, managing chat, tool registration, and message dispatch.\n  - **Tool** and **Toolkit** wrap and organize executable functions, supporting both LLM-initiated and direct execution.\n  - Tools can be registered for \"execution\" (actual code run), \"propose\" (LLM can suggest the tool), or both.\n  - Agents may support custom execution backends or context (e.g., Jupyter, subprocess, remote API).\n  - Group settings (multi-agent chats) may require careful environment management to avoid conflicts or resource leaks.\n  - LLM-generated code execution is supported via secure evaluation interfaces, and often includes output/error capture.\n  examples:\n- title: \"Registering and Executing a Tool\"\n  description: |\n    Register a Python function as a tool with an agent, then execute it via agent interaction.\n  code: |\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n    from autogen.tools import tool\n\n    # Define a tool (function) to add two numbers\n    @tool(name=\"add\", description=\"Add two numbers\")\n    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a + b\n\n    # Create an agent and register the tool\n    agent = ConversableAgent(\n        name=\"assistant\",\n        system_message=\"You can execute tools.\",\n        llm_config={...}\n    )\n    agent.register_for_execution()(add)\n\n    # Simulate code execution in response to a message\n    result = agent.execute_tool(\"add\", a=2, b=3)\n    print(result)  # Output: 5\n\n- title: \"Tool Registration for LLM and Execution\"\n  description: |\n    Register a tool for both LLM function-calling and direct execution, allowing agents to use it in conversations or directly.\n  code: |\n    @tool(name=\"multiply\", description=\"Multiply two numbers\")\n    def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a * b\n\n    agent.register_tool(multiply)  # Registers for both propose and execute\n\n- title: \"Custom Execution Environment (Jupyter Backend)\"\n  description: |\n    Configure an agent to execute code snippets in a Jupyter kernel (e.g., for Python code execution isolation).\n  code: |\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n    from autogen.execution.jupyter import JupyterExecutionBackend\n\n    agent = ConversableAgent(\n        name=\"notebook_agent\",\n        system_message=\"You can execute Python code in a Jupyter kernel.\",\n        llm_config={...},\n        execution_backend=JupyterExecutionBackend()\n    )\n\n    code = \"print(2 + 2)\"\n    output = agent.execute_code(code)\n    print(output)  # Output: 4\n\n- title: \"Group Chat: Managing Tool Execution in Multi-Agent Workflows\"\n  description: |\n    Set up a group chat where agents can execute code/tools in a coordinated way, ensuring that each agent's execution context is managed.\n  code: |\n    from autogen import GroupChat, GroupChatManager, ConversableAgent\n    from autogen.tools import tool\n\n    @tool(name=\"increment\", description=\"Increment a number\")\n    def increment(x: int) -> int:\n        return x + 1\n\n    agent1 = ConversableAgent(\"agent1\")\n    agent2 = ConversableAgent(\"agent2\")\n    agent1.register_for_execution()(increment)\n    agent2.register_for_execution()(increment)\n\n    groupchat = GroupChat([agent1, agent2])\n    manager = GroupChatManager(groupchat)\n    agent1.initiate_chat(manager, message=\"Increment 5\")\n  best_practices:\n- \"Always register tools with accurate type hints and descriptions for reliable code execution and LLM integration.\"\n- \"Use decorators (e.g., @tool) for registering functions as tools;

Registering your custom agents ensures they are discoverable and usable within the broader agent ecosystem.\n  explanation: |\n    The framework is built around the ConversableAgent abstraction, which encapsulates agentic communication, tool usage, and messaging workflows. To tailor agents for advanced scenariosâ€”such as domain-specific reasoning, custom tool integration, or unique conversational logicâ€”you can define your own agent classes.\nCustom agents are typically created by either:\n  - **Subclassing ConversableAgent**: Inherit its robust messaging, tool management, and reply logic, and override or extend methods to customize behavior.\n  - **Implementing the Agent Protocol**: Define the required interface (`name`, `description`, `send`, `receive`, `generate_reply`, etc.) if you need lower-level or non-standard agent logic.\n\nAfter creating a custom agent class, you can instantiate agents, register tools (functions or toolkits), and participate in direct or group conversations. Registering agents with orchestration components (e.g., GroupChatManager, registries) makes them accessible for workflows like multi-agent chat or automated handoffs.\n\n**Key extension points include:**\n  - Overriding `generate_reply` for custom message handling.\n  - Registering tools with `register_for_llm` or `register_tool` for LLM function-calling.\n  - Customizing chat history, system messages, or reply triggers.\n  - Integrating with external systems or APIs.\n\nThis flexibility enables you to build agents for tasks such as domain-specific assistants, workflow organizers, API bridges, or even simulation bots.\n  examples:\n- title: \"Subclassing ConversableAgent for Domain-Specific Logic\"\n  description: |\n    Create a custom agent that gives weather advice by overriding the reply generation method.\n  code: |\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n    class WeatherAgent(ConversableAgent):\n        def generate_reply(self, messages, sender, config, **kwargs):\n            last_message = messages[-1]['content']\n            if \"weather\" in last_message.lower():\n                return \"The weather is sunny today. ðŸŒž\"\n            return super().generate_reply(messages, sender, config, **kwargs)\n\n    agent = WeatherAgent(\n        name=\"weather_bot\",\n        system_message=\"You are a weather assistant.\",\n        llm_config={...}\n    )\n    user = ConversableAgent(name=\"user\", human_input_mode=\"ALWAYS\")\n    agent.initiate_chat(user, message=\"What's the weather?\")\n- title: \"Implementing the Agent Protocol Directly\"\n  description: |\n    Build a lightweight agent by implementing only the protocol, suitable for non-chat or API-based logic.\n  code: |\n    from autogen.agentchat.agent import Agent\n\n    class EchoAgent(Agent):\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            self.name = name\n            self.description = \"Echoes all messages.\"\n        def send(self, message, recipient, **kwargs):\n            recipient.receive(f\"Echo: {message}\", sender=self)\n        def receive(self, message, sender, **kwargs):\n            self.send(message, sender)\n        def generate_reply(self, messages, sender, config, **kwargs):\n            return f\"Echo: {messages[-1]['content']}\"\n\n    echo = EchoAgent(\"echoer\")\n    # Use with a ConversableAgent or in a group chat\n- title: \"Registering and Using Tools in a Custom Agent\"\n  description: |\n    Equip your custom agent with tools, allowing LLMs to call functions via tool registration.\n  code: |\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n    from autogen.tools import tool\n\n    class MathAgent(ConversableAgent):\n        pass\n\n    math_agent = MathAgent(name=\"math_bot\", system_message=\"You solve math problems.\", llm_config={...})\n\n    @tool(name=\"multiply\", description=\"Multiply two numbers\")\n    def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a * b\n\n    math_agent.register_for_llm()(multiply)\n    # Now, LLMs can invoke 'multiply' during chat!\n  best_practices:\n- \"Always give each custom agent a unique, descriptive name to avoid confusion in group or multi-agent settings.\"\n- \"Prefer subclassing ConversableAgent for most use cases to leverage built-in chat and tool logic.\"\n- \"Register all tools and reply hooks before starting chats;

The framework provides abstractions and decorators for defining, registering, and managing custom tools, ensuring seamless function-calling by LLMs and agents.\n  explanation: |\n    In the agent framework, \"tools\" are lightweight wrappers around Python callables (functions, methods, or objects) that expose their signature and description to both agents and LLMs. This enables LLMs to propose tool usage (function calls) during conversations, and lets agents execute these tools as part of their workflow.\n\n    You can create a custom tool by:\n      - Writing a Python function with clear type annotations and a docstring or description.\n      - Decorating the function with the `@tool` decorator (from `autogen.tools`) to mark it as a Tool.\n      - Registering the tool with an agent (using `.register_tool`, `.register_for_llm`, or `.register_for_execution`).\n      - Optionally grouping tools using a `Toolkit` for collective management and registration.\n\n    Once registered, tools become available to the agentâ€™s LLM for function-calling and/or direct execution. This allows the agent to invoke your custom logic in response to user queries or during multi-agent workflows.\n\n    The system supports interoperability with external tool ecosystems (like LangChain or CrewAI) via converters, but the recommended pattern is to use the provided abstractions for native tool development. For complex parameter schemas, Pydantic models can be used for input validation.\n\n    Tool registration is compositional: agents and toolkits can hold and manage multiple tools, and tools must be registered before initiating chats to ensure visibility for LLM function-calling.\n\n  examples:\n    - title: \"Defining and Registering a Simple Custom Tool\"\n      description: \"Create an addition tool and register it for LLM function-calling.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.tools import tool\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent\n\n        @tool(name=\"add\", description=\"Add two numbers together.\")\n        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            \"\"\"Adds two integers and returns the result.\"\"\"\n            return a + b\n\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\n            name=\"calculator\",\n            system_message=\"You are a math assistant.\",\n            llm_config={...}\n        )\n\n        agent.register_for_llm()(add)  # Make tool available for LLM function calling\n\n        # Now, when chatting with the agent, the LLM can propose using 'add'\n    - title: \"Grouping Multiple Tools with a Toolkit\"\n      description: \"Bundle related tools and register them collectively.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.tools import tool, Toolkit\n\n        @tool(name=\"multiply\", description=\"Multiply two numbers.\")\n        def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            return a * b\n\n        @tool(name=\"subtract\", description=\"Subtract two numbers.\")\n        def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            return a - b\n\n        math_toolkit = Toolkit([multiply, subtract])\n        math_toolkit.register_for_llm(agent)  # Register all tools in the toolkit\n\n    - title: \"Custom Tool with Complex Input Using Pydantic\"\n      description: \"Define a tool that validates its input using a Pydantic model.\"\n      code: |\n        from pydantic import BaseModel\n        from autogen.tools import tool\n\n        class Employee(BaseModel):\n            name: str\n            age: int\n            department: str\n\n        @tool(name=\"add_employee\", description=\"Add an employee record.\")\n        def add_employee(employee: Employee) -> str:\n            # Save employee to database (stub)\n            return f\"Added employee: {employee.name}\"\n\n        agent.register_for_llm()(add_employee)\n\n    - title: \"Registering a Tool for Direct Execution (By Agent)\"\n      description: \"Allow an agent to execute a tool directly, not just propose via LLM.\"\n      code: |\n        agent.register_for_execution()(add)  # Agent can execute 'add' directly in its logic\n\n    - title: \"Converting External Tools (Interoperability)\"\n      description: \"Convert a LangChain or CrewAI tool for use as an agent tool.\"\n      code: |\n        from autogen.tools.interop import Interoperability\n\n        # Assume langchain_tool is an instance of a LangChain tool\n        ag2_tool = Interoperability.convert_tool(langchain_tool)\n        agent.register_tool(ag2_tool)\n\n  best_practices:\n    - \"Use the @tool decorator to define tools;

By implementing provider-specific configuration and client logic, you enable agents and toolchains to interact with additional LLM backends in a unified, interoperable manner.\n\n  explanation: |\n    The framework uses standardized abstractionsâ€”such as `LLMConfig`, `LLMConfigEntry`, and agent protocolsâ€”to decouple agent logic from specific LLM providers. To add support for a new LLM or API backend:\n\n    1. **Define a Provider-Specific LLMConfigEntry:**  \n       Subclass `LLMConfigEntry` to represent your provider's model configuration (API endpoint, key, parameters, etc.). This ensures consistent validation and serialization.\n\n    2. **Implement a Provider Client:**  \n       Create a client class responsible for sending requests to your LLM provider, parsing responses, and handling errors. This client should conform to the expected interface (e.g., a `generate()` or `complete()` method).\n\n    3. **Register with LLMConfig:**  \n       Your new `LLMConfigEntry` should be registered within an `LLMConfig` object, allowing agents and group managers to select and use your backend seamlessly.\n\n    4. **Integrate with Agents:**  \n       Pass your custom config to agents (e.g., `ConversableAgent`) via their `llm_config` parameter. Agents and toolkits will then use your backend for all LLM calls.\n\n    This design enables features like context management, filtering, and group orchestration to work with any compliant LLM provider, fostering extensibility and maintainability.\n\n  examples:\n    - title: \"Basic Integration of a Custom LLM Provider\"\n      description: |\n        This example shows how to add a new provider called `SuperLLM` by defining a config entry and a simple client.\n      code: |\n        # 1.

These patterns enable the creation of agent \"swarms\" (large, parallel groups of agents), nesting (agents managing sub-chats or delegating tasks to sub-agents), and sophisticated transition logic between agents or agent groups. They facilitate scalable, modular, and context-aware multi-agent systems suitable for complex automation, problem-solving, or simulation scenarios.\n\n  explanation: |\n    In agent frameworks, a \"swarm\" refers to a group of agents collaboratingâ€”often in parallel or with dynamic coordinationâ€”to solve a problem or process tasks. The swarm pattern leverages abstractions like `GroupChat` and `GroupChatManager` to manage agent membership, conversation state, and orchestration logic (e.g., round-robin, auto-selection, or custom strategies).\n\n    Nested agents extend this idea by allowing agents to initiate, manage, or participate in sub-chats or sub-groups (i.e., \"nested\" group chats), enabling hierarchical workflows. For example, a manager agent could delegate sub-tasks to specialized agents, each of whom may further orchestrate their own group of sub-agents.\n\n    Advanced transitions allow for flexible handoffs and control flows between agents or groups, using constructs like `TransitionTarget`, `OnCondition`, and `OnContextCondition`. These enable dynamic routing of conversation or task ownership based on LLM outputs, context, or custom rules.\n\n    The core agent abstraction (`ConversableAgent` and its protocol) supports these patterns by providing message handling, tool integration, and chat management. Group orchestration is abstracted via `GroupChat`, `GroupChatManager`, and patterns such as `AutoPattern`, which encapsulate different strategies for agent selection and transition.\n\n  examples:\n    - title: \"Creating a Swarm of Agents for Parallel Task Solving\"\n      description: |\n        This example demonstrates orchestrating a swarm of agents to collaboratively solve sub-tasks using an auto pattern for speaker selection.\n      code: |\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent, GroupChat, GroupChatManager\n        from autogen.agentchat.group.patterns.auto import AutoPattern\n\n        # Create individual agents\n        agents = [\n            ConversableAgent(name=f\"worker_{i}\", system_message=\"You are a domain expert.\", llm_config={...})\n            for i in range(5)\n        ]\n\n        # Define a swarm orchestration pattern\n        pattern = AutoPattern(initial_agent=agents[0], agents=agents)\n\n        # Prepare the group chat (the swarm)\n        groupchat, manager = pattern.prepare_group_chat(max_rounds=10, messages=[{\"content\": \"Solve the problem\"}])\n\n        # Initiate the swarm conversation\n        agents[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=\"Let's break down the task.\")\n\n    - title: \"Nested Group Chat: Manager Agent Delegates to Expert Subgroups\"\n      description: |\n        This example shows a manager agent that can spawn and manage a nested group chat to solve a sub-task, demonstrating hierarchical agent orchestration.\n      code: |\n        from autogen import ConversableAgent, GroupChatManager\n        from autogen.agentchat.group.patterns.auto import AutoPattern\n\n        # Define expert agents\n        experts = [ConversableAgent(name=f\"expert_{i}\", llm_config={...}) for i in range(3)]\n        expert_pattern = AutoPattern(initial_agent=experts[0], agents=experts)\n        expert_groupchat, expert_manager = expert_pattern.prepare_group_chat(max_rounds=5)\n\n        # Define the manager agent\n        class ManagerAgent(ConversableAgent):\n            def generate_reply(self, messages, sender, config):\n                # On a specific trigger, start a nested group chat\n                if \"delegate to experts\" in messages[-1][\"content\"]:\n                    # Start conversation with the expert manager (nested chat)\n                    self.initiate_chat(expert_manager, message=\"Please handle this sub-task.\")\n                    return \"Delegated sub-task to expert group.\"\n                return super().generate_reply(messages, sender, config)\n\n        manager = ManagerAgent(name=\"manager\", llm_config={...})\n        manager.initiate_chat(expert_manager, message=\"delegate to experts\")\n\n    - title: \"Conditional Agent Handoff with OnCondition\"\n      description: |\n        Use condition-based transitions to dynamically select the next agent based on message content.\n      code: |\n        from autogen.agentchat.group.transition import OnCondition, TransitionTarget\n        from autogen.agentchat.group.patterns.auto import AutoPattern\n\n        def is_financial_question(content):\n            return \"finance\" in content\n\n        pattern = AutoPattern(\n            agents=[agent_a, agent_b],\n            transitions=[\n                OnCondition(\n                    condition=lambda m: is_financial_question(m[\"content\"]),\n                    target=TransitionTarget(agent=\"finance_expert\")\n                )\n            ]\n        )\n        groupchat, manager = pattern.prepare_group_chat()\n\n  best_practices:\n    - \"Assign unique, descriptive names to all agents in a swarm or nested group to aid tracking and debugging.\"\n    - \"Use orchestration patterns (e.g., AutoPattern, RoundRobin) to encapsulate agent selection logic;

This is essential for conversational interfaces, live chatbots, voice assistants, and agent-driven streaming applications.\n\n  explanation: |\n    Traditional agent workflows process full user messages in batch, waiting for an entire prompt before responding. In contrast, realtime agents leverage streaming APIs (such as OpenAI's streaming endpoints), observer hooks, and audio adapters to handle data as it arrivesâ€”enabling responsive, interactive experiences.\n\n    Key abstractions for realtime agents include:\n\n    - **ConversableAgent (and Agent Protocols):** Provides the foundation for sending/receiving messages and registering tools, supporting async and streaming interactions.\n    - **Observers:** Components that monitor events (e.g., message received, token generated) and trigger callbacks, enabling real-time updates and UI refreshes.\n    - **Audio Adapters:** Interfaces that handle conversion between audio streams and text, supporting speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) for voice-enabled agents.\n\n    A typical realtime agent workflow involves:\n      1.

By systematically applying appropriate testing techniques, developers can validate the correctness, reliability, and integration of complex agentic behaviors, orchestration patterns, and utility modules.\n  explanation: |\n    The agent framework's modular and extensible designâ€”spanning agents, tools, group chat orchestrations, and configuration utilitiesâ€”necessitates robust testing methodologies. Testing Patterns refer to the set of practices and patterns employed to verify both individual components and their collaborations, including:\n- **Unit Testing**: Isolating and testing single components (e.g., a tool function or an agent's message handler).\n- **Integration Testing**: Validating interactions among multiple components (e.g., agent-tool registration, group chat workflows).\n- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulating real-world scenarios (e.g., a full chat session with tool usage and group transitions).\n- **Mocking and Stubbing**: Using mocks for LLM responses or external APIs to ensure deterministic tests.\n- **Test Utilities**: Leveraging built-in test helpers (e.g., mock agents, dummy LLM configs) for setup and teardown.\n\nHigh test coverage is critical due to the asynchronous, multi-agent, and tool-executing nature of the framework. Test suites should target:\n\n- **ConversableAgent and Agent Protocols**: Message flow, tool registration, chat history, and protocol compliance.\n- **Tool and Toolkit**: Tool wrapping, registration, execution, and interoperability.\n- **GroupChat Patterns**: Orchestration logic, speaker selection, transitions, and group manager workflows.\n- **LLMConfig and Utilities**: Configuration parsing, context management, and filtering.\n\nThis ensures that both individual features and their combinations behave as intended and can be maintained as the codebase evolves.\n  examples:\n- title: \"Unit Testing a Tool Registration on an Agent\"\n  description: \"Verifies that a tool function is correctly registered and callable via the agent.\"\n  code: |\n    import pytest\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n    from autogen.tools import tool\n\n    @tool(name=\"add\", description=\"Add two numbers\")\n    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a + b\n\n    def test_tool_registration():\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\"test_agent\")\n        agent.register_tool(add)\n        assert \"add\" in agent.list_tools()\n- title: \"Integration Test: Agent Using a Tool in a Chat\"\n  description: \"Tests that an agent can use a registered tool during conversation, using a mock LLM.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen import ConversableAgent\n    from autogen.tools import tool\n\n    class DummyLLM:\n        def generate_reply(self, *args, **kwargs):\n            return {\"content\": \"I will use the add tool.\"}\n\n    @tool(name=\"add\", description=\"Add two numbers\")\n    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        return a + b\n\n    def test_agent_tool_usage(monkeypatch):\n        agent = ConversableAgent(\"agent\", llm_config={\"llm\": DummyLLM()})\n        agent.register_tool(add)\n\n        #

They abstract common patterns, simplify repetitive tasks, and provide robust scaffolding for working with agents, tools, group chats, LLM configurations, and tool interoperability. These utilities are essential for both internal framework development and user applications, enabling rapid prototyping, easier testability, and improved code clarity.\n  explanation: |\n    The agent framework includes a rich set of utility and helper functions distributed across its submodules. These utilities serve several purposes:\n- **Testing and Mocking**: Provide mock agents, fake toolkits, and test harnesses to simulate LLM responses or agent conversations, making it easy to validate logic without connecting to live models.\n- **Serialization and Inspection**: Offer functions to serialize/deserialize agents, tools, and configurations to/from JSON, and inspect or summarize their state for debugging or logging.\n- **Tool and Agent Management**: Simplify registration, deregistration, and lookup of tools and agents, ensuring consistent interfaces and reducing boilerplate.\n- **Pattern Utilities**: Support creation and management of group chat patterns, including speaker selection utilities, transition helpers, and group orchestration scaffolding.\n- **Configuration Helpers**: Enable environment-based loading, filtering, and context management of LLM configurations, making it easy to switch between providers or model setups.\n- **Interoperability Adapters**: Convert tools and agents from external ecosystems into native framework abstractions through registry and conversion utilities.\n\nThese helpers are often used directly in notebooks, unit tests, or as part of higher-level abstractions, and are crucial for writing maintainable, testable, and extensible agent applications.\n  examples:\n- title: \"Mocking Agents and Tools for Testing\"\n  description: \"Create a fake agent and tool to simulate interactions without real LLM calls.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.testing import MockConversableAgent, mock_tool\n\n    agent = MockConversableAgent(name=\"mock_assistant\")\n    add_tool = mock_tool(\"add\", lambda a, b: a + b, description=\"Add numbers\")\n    agent.register_tool(add_tool)\n\n    # Simulate a chat\n    reply = agent.generate_reply(\"What is 2 + 3?\", tools=[add_tool])\n    print(reply)\n- title: \"Serializing and Deserializing Configurations\"\n  description: \"Serialize an LLMConfig to JSON and load it back for reproducible tests.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig\n\n    config = LLMConfig.from_env(\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\")\n    json_str = config.to_json()\n    config2 = LLMConfig.from_json(json_str)\n- title: \"Tool Lookup and Registration Helpers\"\n  description: \"Dynamically register and find tools for an agent.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.tools import tool, find_tool_by_name\n\n    @tool(name=\"greet\", description=\"Greets the user\")\n    def greet(name: str) -> str:\n        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n    agent.register_tool(greet)\n    found_tool = find_tool_by_name(agent.tools, \"greet\")\n    print(found_tool.description)\n- title: \"Group Pattern Utilities\"\n  description: \"Using a utility to set up a round-robin speaker selection for group chat.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.agentchat.group.utils import round_robin_selector\n\n    # Given a GroupChat and agent list\n    next_speaker = round_robin_selector(last_speaker, groupchat)\n- title: \"Interoperability Conversion\"\n  description: \"Convert a LangChain tool to a native Tool using a utility.\"\n  code: |\n    from autogen.interop import convert_tool_from_langchain\n\n    lc_tool = ...  # Some LangChain tool instance\n    ag_tool = convert_tool_from_langchain(lc_tool)\n  best_practices:\n- \"Isolate utility usage in tests and prototyping code to avoid accidental production dependencies.\"\n- \"Use provided registration and lookup helpers instead of manipulating internal agent/tool dictionaries directly.\"\n- \"Prefer serialization utilities for saving/loading configurations and states to ensure compatibility across framework versions.\"\n- \"Leverage mocking and fake agents for offline testing and CI pipelines.\"\n- \"Utilize pattern and orchestration helpers for group chat logic rather than reinventing orchestration mechanisms.\"\n  related_concepts:\n- name: \"ConversableAgent (and Agent Protocols)\"\n  description: \"Utilities often assist in managing, testing, or extending agents, supporting the core abstractions.\"\n- name: \"Tool and Toolkit\"\n  description: \"Helpers simplify tool registration, lookup, and conversion, and are essential for testing tool-based workflows.\"\n- name: \"GroupChat, GroupChatManager, and Patterns\"\n  description: \"Pattern and orchestration utilities support group chat setup, speaker selection, and transitions.\"\n- name: \"LLMConfig and LLMConfigEntry\"\n  description: \"Configuration helpers enable flexible, testable management of model providers and serialization.\"\n- name: \"Tool Interoperability\"\n  description: \"Interoperability adapters and registries use utility functions to convert and manage tools across ecosystems.\"\n"}}}
