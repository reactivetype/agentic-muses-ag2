It specifies how agents send and receive messages, process events, and maintain consistent interactionsâ€”allowing for scalable, modular, and flexible software architectures. Agent protocols are foundational in multi-agent systems, distributed computing, and modern AI frameworks.\nExplanation\nAt its core, the agent protocol dictates how agents interact:\n\nMessage Structure: Defines how information is packaged for communication.\nAgent Classes: Different types of agents (e.g., reactive, proactive, hybrid) may implement the protocol differently.\nEvent Handling: Outlines how agents respond to internal or external events.\n\nAgents\nAn agent is an autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking actions to achieve goals. In Python, an agent is often modeled as a class with methods for handling messages and events.\nMessages\nMessages are structured data objects exchanged between agents. Each message usually includes:\n\nSender: The agent initiating communication.\nReceiver: The intended recipient agent.\nType: The kind of message (e.g., request, response, inform).\nPayload: The content or data being communicated.\n\nEvents\nAn event represents a significant change or occurrence in the system (e.g., a timer fires, a resource state changes). Agents are typically designed to handle events either synchronously or asynchronously.\nAgent Protocol Interface\nA typical agent protocol provides:\n\nMethods for sending/receiving messages\nEvent handling mechanisms\nLifecycle management (start, stop, etc.)\n\nExample Protocol in Python (Pseudo-code):\nclass AgentProtocol:\n    def send(self, message):\n        \"\"\"Send a message to another agent\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def receive(self):\n        \"\"\"Receive a message from another agent\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        \"\"\"Process an incoming event\"\"\"\n        pass\n\nExamples\n1. Defining a Simple Agent and Message\nclass Message:\n    def __init__(self, sender, receiver, msg_type, payload):\n        self.sender = sender\n        self.receiver = receiver\n        self.msg_type = msg_type\n        self.payload = payload\n\nclass Agent:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def send(self, message, agent_registry):\n        receiver_agent = agent_registry[message.receiver]\n        receiver_agent.receive(message)\n\n    def receive(self, message):\n        print(f\"{self.name} received {message.msg_type} from {message.sender}: {message.payload}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nagent_registry = {}\nagent_a = Agent(\"AgentA\")\nagent_b = Agent(\"AgentB\")\nagent_registry[\"AgentA\"] = agent_a\nagent_registry[\"AgentB\"] = agent_b\n\nmsg = Message(sender=\"AgentA\", receiver=\"AgentB\", msg_type=\"inform\", payload={\"data\": 42})\nagent_a.send(msg, agent_registry)\n\n2. Handling Events\nclass Event:\n    def __init__(self, name, data):\n        self.name = name\n        self.data = data\n\nclass EventDrivenAgent(Agent):\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        print(f\"{self.name} processing event: {event.name} with data {event.data}\")\n\n# Example event handling\nevent = Event(name=\"timeout\", data={\"duration\": 5})\nevent_agent = EventDrivenAgent(\"TimerAgent\")\nevent_agent.handle_event(event)\n\n3. Different Agent Classes\nclass ReactiveAgent(Agent):\n    def receive(self, message):\n        print(f\"{self.name} reacts immediately to: {message.msg_type}\")\n\nclass ProactiveAgent(Agent):\n    def plan(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is planning ahead.\")\n\n# Instantiate and use\nreactive = ReactiveAgent(\"Reactive\")\nproactive = ProactiveAgent(\"Proactive\")\nreactive.receive(msg)\nproactive.plan()\n\nBest Practices\n\nClearly define message and event structures: Use consistent formats for all communications.\nEncapsulate protocol logic: Implement protocol handling in a dedicated class or module.\nUse meaningful message types: Helps agents understand intent and context.\nHandle unknown messages/events gracefully: Avoid crashes on unexpected input.\nSeparate agent logic from protocol specifics: Promotes modularity and reuse.\nDocument agent interfaces and communication patterns: Eases maintenance and collaboration.\n\nCommon Pitfalls\n\nIgnoring error handling in message delivery.\nTight coupling between agents and protocol implementation.\nHardcoding agent names or addresses.\nFailing to validate message payloads.\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent-based Modeling\nEvent-driven Programming\nObject-Oriented Programming\nDesign Patterns - Observer\nMulti-Agent Systems\nMessaging Protocols (e.g., MQTT, AMQP)\nPython asyncio for asynchronous messaging\n\n\nFor further reading, see: Foundations of Agents and Messages, Agent Architecture, and Communication in Distributed Systems.\n"},"chapters/foundations-of-agents-and-messages/llmagent.html":{"url":"chapters/foundations-of-agents-and-messages/llmagent.html","title":"LLMAgent","keywords":"","body":"LLMAgent\nOverview\nAn LLMAgent is a software entity designed to interact with large language models (LLMs) through a standardized agent protocol. LLMAgents communicate by sending and receiving structured messages, enabling complex workflows such as question answering, code generation, and task automation. The agent protocol ensures interoperability between various agent classes and message types, allowing seamless integration of different LLM-powered components.\nExplanation\nLLMAgents are at the core of modern AI-driven applications, acting as intermediaries between users, other agents, and LLMs. They encapsulate logic for:\n\nSending requests (prompts, commands)\nReceiving and processing responses (completions, actions)\nManaging multi-step interactions (conversation, tool use)\n\nAgent Protocol\nThe agent protocol defines how agents communicate:\n\nMessages: Structured data packets containing content, sender, receiver, and metadata.\nEvents: Notifications about important occurrences (e.g., message received, error occurred).\nActions: Special message types that trigger operations (e.g., calling a function, fetching data).\n\nAgent Classes\nLLMAgents can be categorized based on their roles:\n\nUserAgent: Represents human input.\nToolAgent: Interfaces with external tools or APIs.\nLLMAgent: Specializes in communicating with LLMs, parsing prompts, and interpreting responses.\nCoordinatorAgent: Manages workflows and message routing between agents.\n\nMessage and Event Structure\nA message typically includes:\n\nsender: The agent sending the message\nreceiver: The agent or component intended to receive the message\ncontent: The main payload (text, data, command)\ntimestamp: When the message was created\nmetadata: Additional context (e.g., message type, priority)\n\nEvents log and notify the system about state changes or results, such as:\n\nMessage delivered\nError occurred\nTask completed\n\nExamples\nBasic LLMAgent Class\nclass LLMAgent:\n    def __init__(self, name, llm):\n        self.name = name\n        self.llm = llm  # LLM interface (e.g., OpenAI API client)\n\n    def send_message(self, receiver, content, metadata=None):\n        message = {\n            'sender': self.name,\n            'receiver': receiver,\n            'content': content,\n            'timestamp': time.time(),\n            'metadata': metadata or {}\n        }\n        # send the message to the receiver (could be another agent or LLM)\n        return message\n\n    def receive_message(self, message):\n        print(f\"Received message: {message['content']}\")\n        # Process message and possibly generate a response\n        if message['receiver'] == self.name:\n            return self.respond(message)\n\n    def respond(self, message):\n        # Example: send content to LLM and return reply\n        response = self.llm.generate(message['content'])\n        return self.send_message(\n            receiver=message['sender'],\n            content=response,\n            metadata={'response_to': message['metadata'].get('id')}\n        )\n\nMessage Structure Example\nmessage = {\n    \"sender\": \"UserAgent\",\n    \"receiver\": \"LLMAgent\",\n    \"content\": \"What is the weather today?\",\n    \"timestamp\": 1718412000.0,\n    \"metadata\": {\n        \"id\": \"msg123\",\n        \"type\": \"query\"\n    }\n}\n\nAgent Communication Flow\n\nUserAgent sends a query to LLMAgent.\nLLMAgent processes the message and queries the LLM.\nLLMAgent sends a response message back to UserAgent.\n\nuser_agent = UserAgent(\"UserAgent\")\nllm_agent = LLMAgent(\"LLMAgent\", llm=OpenAIClient())\n\n# User initiates conversation\nmsg = user_agent.send_message(\"LLMAgent\", \"Tell me a joke.\")\n\n# LLMAgent receives and processes\nreply = llm_agent.receive_message(msg)\n\nBest Practices\n\nUse clear message structures: Ensure all messages include sender, receiver, content, and metadata.\nHandle errors gracefully: Implement event notifications for errors (e.g., invalid input, LLM failure).\nLog events: Keep track of message exchanges and agent actions for debugging.\nSeparate concerns: Distinguish agent classes by role (e.g., don't combine tool and LLM logic in one agent).\nEnsure extensibility: Design the agent protocol and classes for easy addition of new agent types or message formats.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nNeglecting to handle unexpected message types or missing metadata.\nTight coupling between agent logic and LLM backend.\nFailing to track message state, leading to lost or duplicate responses.\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent Protocol\nMessages and Events\nToolAgent\nCoordinatorAgent\nPrompt Engineering\nOpenAI API Documentation\n\nFor further reading, see Multi-Agent Systems and Design Patterns for Conversational Agents.\n"},"chapters/foundations-of-agents-and-messages/conversableagent.html":{"url":"chapters/foundations-of-agents-and-messages/conversableagent.html","title":"ConversableAgent","keywords":"","body":"ConversableAgent\nOverview\nA ConversableAgent is an abstraction in agent-based systems that enables agents to communicate using structured messages.

The ConversableAgent extends a basic agent model by adding conversational capabilities, such as maintaining dialogue context and handling various message types and events.\nExplanation\nIn agent-oriented programming, agents are autonomous entities capable of perceiving their environment and acting upon it. While a simple agent may only react to environmental changes, a ConversableAgent is explicitly designed to interact with other agents through a structured messaging protocol.\nKey Features\n\nMessage-Based Communication: Agents exchange information via messages that encapsulate data, intent, and metadata.\nEvent Handling: Agents can handle events triggered by incoming messages or changes in conversation state.\nDialog Management: Maintains the context of ongoing conversations, enabling multi-turn dialogues.\nExtensibility: Supports custom message types, protocols, and behaviors.\n\nAgent Protocol\nThe protocol typically defines:\n\nMessage Structure: Standard fields like sender, recipient, content, and type.\nLifecycle Events: Events such as message received, message processed, error, or timeout.\nCommunication Patterns: One-to-one, broadcast, or request-response messaging.\n\nClass Hierarchy\n\nAgent: The base class for all agents. Handles basic perception and actions.\nConversableAgent: Extends Agent with message handling and conversation management.\n\nExample Class Skeleton\nclass Agent:\n    def act(self, observation):\n        pass  # Basic action logic\n\nclass ConversableAgent(Agent):\n    def send_message(self, recipient, message):\n        pass  # Logic for sending a message\n\n    def receive_message(self, message):\n        pass  # Logic for receiving a message\n\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        pass  # Custom event handling\n\nMessage and Event Structure\nA typical message might be represented as a dictionary or a custom object:\nmessage = {\n    \"sender\": \"agent_1\",\n    \"recipient\": \"agent_2\",\n    \"type\": \"inform\",\n    \"content\": \"Task completed.\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-06-15T12:00:00Z\"\n}\n\nEvents might be triggered by message reception or conversation state changes:\nevent = {\n    \"type\": \"message_received\",\n    \"message\": message\n}\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Basic ConversableAgent\nclass ConversableAgent(Agent):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.inbox = []\n\n    def send_message(self, recipient, content):\n        message = {\n            \"sender\": self.name,\n            \"recipient\": recipient.name,\n            \"content\": content\n        }\n        recipient.receive_message(message)\n\n    def receive_message(self, message):\n        print(f\"{self.name} received: {message['content']} from {message['sender']}\")\n        self.inbox.append(message)\n        self.handle_event({\"type\": \"message_received\", \"message\": message})\n\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        if event[\"type\"] == \"message_received\":\n            print(f\"{self.name} handling event: {event}\")\n\nUsage:\nalice = ConversableAgent(\"Alice\")\nbob = ConversableAgent(\"Bob\")\n\nalice.send_message(bob, \"Hello, Bob!\")\n# Output:\n# Bob received: Hello, Bob! from Alice\n# Bob handling event: {'type': 'message_received', ...}\n\nExample 2: Handling Different Message Types\nclass AdvancedConversableAgent(ConversableAgent):\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        message = event[\"message\"]\n        if message.get(\"type\") == \"request\":\n            self.process_request(message)\n        elif message.get(\"type\") == \"inform\":\n            print(f\"{self.name} was informed: {message['content']}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{self.name} received unknown message type.\")\n\n    def process_request(self, message):\n        print(f\"{self.name} processing request: {message['content']}\")\n        # Respond to request, etc.\n\nBest Practices\n\nDefine Clear Message Schemas: Ensures all agents interpret messages consistently.\nMaintain Conversation Context: Use identifiers or state tracking for multi-turn dialogues.\nHandle Unexpected Events: Gracefully handle unknown message types or malformed messages.\nDecouple Message Processing: Separate message parsing from business logic for maintainability.\nLimit Side Effects: Keep message handlers isolated to prevent unintended agent behavior.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nIgnoring message type or metadata, leading to misinterpretation.\nNot validating message content, causing runtime errors.\nAllowing shared state between agents, breaking autonomy.\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent: The base abstraction for autonomous entities (see \"Agent\" documentation).\nMessage Passing: The fundamental communication mechanism in agent systems.\nEvent-Driven Programming: Relevant for handling message and event callbacks.\nMulti-Agent Systems: Broader context for agent interactions.\nProtocol Design: For designing robust agent communication protocols.\n\n\nFor further reading, refer to classic agent frameworks like JADE or libraries such as spaCy's agent module (if available).\n"},"chapters/foundations-of-agents-and-messages/basemessage-and-message-serialization.html":{"url":"chapters/foundations-of-agents-and-messages/basemessage-and-message-serialization.html","title":"BaseMessage and message serialization","keywords":"","body":"BaseMessage and message serialization\nOverview\nIn agent-based systems, agents communicate by exchanging structured data known as messages. The BaseMessage class typically defines the foundation for all messages exchanged between agents. To facilitate communication, these messages are often serializedâ€”converted into a format suitable for transmission or storage (e.g., JSON or binary). Understanding the structure of BaseMessage and the process of message serialization is fundamental to building robust and interoperable agent systems.\n\nExplanation\nThe Agent Protocol\nAgents operate by sending and receiving messages. The agent protocol typically defines:\n\nMessage format: How is information structured?\nSerialization: How is the message converted to/from a transmittable format?\nDeserialization: How is the message reconstructed on receipt?\n\nBaseMessage Structure\nA BaseMessage class generally contains:\n\nMetadata (e.g., sender, recipient, timestamp)\nMessage type (e.g., \"event\", \"command\", \"response\")\nPayload (the actual content of the message)\n\nExample Structure (pseudocode)\nclass BaseMessage:\n    def __init__(self, sender, recipient, msg_type, payload, timestamp=None):\n        self.sender = sender\n        self.recipient = recipient\n        self.msg_type = msg_type\n        self.payload = payload\n        self.timestamp = timestamp or datetime.now()\n\nMessage Serialization\nSerialization is the process of converting an object (like BaseMessage) into a format (string or bytes) that can be sent over a network or saved to disk. The most common formats are:\n\nJSON (human-readable, widely supported)\nPickle (Python-specific, not secure for untrusted data)\nProtobuf/MessagePack (efficient, binary)\n\nDeserialization is the reverse: reconstructing the object from its serialized form.\nWhy Serialization?\n\nInteroperability: Agents may run in different environments or languages.\nPersistence: Messages can be stored and replayed.\nTransmission: Data must be in a standard format to send over a network.\n\nDistinguishing Agent Classes\nAgent classes may handle messages differently:\n\nReactive agents: Respond to events or messages.\nDeliberative agents: Plan actions based on received messages.\nHybrid agents: Combine multiple behaviors.\n\n\nExamples\nDefining a BaseMessage Class\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass BaseMessage:\n    def __init__(self, sender, recipient, msg_type, payload, timestamp=None):\n        self.sender = sender\n        self.recipient = recipient\n        self.msg_type = msg_type\n        self.payload = payload\n        self.timestamp = timestamp or datetime.now().isoformat()\n\n    def serialize(self):\n        return json.dumps({\n            'sender': self.sender,\n            'recipient': self.recipient,\n            'msg_type': self.msg_type,\n            'payload': self.payload,\n            'timestamp': self.timestamp,\n        })\n\n    @classmethod\n    def deserialize(cls, serialized_str):\n        data = json.loads(serialized_str)\n        return cls(**data)\n\nSending and Receiving Messages\n# Creating a message\nmsg = BaseMessage(\n    sender=\"AgentA\",\n    recipient=\"AgentB\",\n    msg_type=\"event\",\n    payload={\"event_type\": \"temperature_update\", \"value\": 22.5}\n)\n\n# Serialize for sending\nserialized_msg = msg.serialize()\nprint(\"Serialized:\", serialized_msg)\n\n# On the receiving end\nreceived_msg = BaseMessage.deserialize(serialized_msg)\nprint(\"Deserialized:\", received_msg.payload)\n\nCustomizing Message Types\nclass EventMessage(BaseMessage):\n    def __init__(self, sender, recipient, payload, timestamp=None):\n        super().__init__(sender, recipient, 'event', payload, timestamp)\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nUse clear and consistent message schemas. All agents should agree on message structure.\nPrefer human-readable serialization (like JSON) for debugging. Use binary formats for efficiency only when necessary.\nValidate messages on receipt. Ensure required fields are present and types are correct.\nAvoid using insecure serialization formats (e.g., Pickle) for untrusted data.\nHandle versioning. If your message schema evolves, include version info for backward compatibility.\nLog serialized messages for traceability and debugging.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent Protocols\nAgent Classes\nEvents and Event Handling\nSerialization in Python (docs)\nMessage-Oriented Middleware\nProtobuf (Protocol Buffers)\n\n\n"},"chapters/conversable-agent-workflow/":{"url":"chapters/conversable-agent-workflow/","title":"Conversable Agent Workflow","keywords":"","body":"Conversable Agent Workflow\nThis chapter explores the workflow and communication patterns of conversable agents.\nPrerequisites\n\nUnderstanding of agent protocols\nKnowledge of message types\nFamiliarity with async programming\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nMaster reply function registration\nUnderstand chat message flow\nLearn about different human input modes\nImplement effective agent communication\n\nChapter Structure\n\nReply function registration\nChat message flow\nHuman input modes\n\n"},"chapters/conversable-agent-workflow/reply-function-registration.html":{"url":"chapters/conversable-agent-workflow/reply-function-registration.html","title":"Reply function registration","keywords":"","body":"Reply function registration\nOverview\nReply function registration is a core mechanism that enables an agent to respond dynamically to incoming messages. By registering reply functions, developers can specify how an agent should react to specific message types, content, or triggers during a conversation. This process allows for modular, maintainable, and context-aware conversation flows, supporting both automated responses and integrating human input where necessary.\n\nExplanation\nIn a conversable agent workflow, reply functions are callbacks or handlers that the agent invokes in response to certain messages or triggers. Registration is the process of associating these functions with specific message patterns, types, or conditions.\nHow it works:\n\nAn agent maintains a registry (often a mapping or list) of reply functions and their associated triggers.\nWhen a message is received, the agent scans the registry to determine if any function should be triggered based on the message's characteristics (e.g., type, intent, content).\nIf a match is found, the corresponding function is executed, producing a reply or initiating an action.\nReply functions can be chained or composed to build complex conversational workflows, including branching, loops, and human-in-the-loop steps.\n\nHuman input modes:Agents can be configured to switch between automated reply functions and modes that solicit human input (e.g., pausing for a human operator to respond), allowing for hybrid workflows.\n\nExamples\n1. Basic Reply Function Registration\ndef greet(message):\n    return \"Hello! How can I help you today?\"\n\nagent.register_reply(trigger=\"greeting\", function=greet)\n\nWhen a message with the type or intent \"greeting\" arrives, the greet function is called.\n\n2. Reply Function with Message Pattern Matching\ndef handle_order(message):\n    item = message.get('item')\n    return f\"Sure, I will help you order {item}.\"\n\nagent.register_reply(trigger=lambda msg: \"order\" in msg.text, function=handle_order)\n\nHere, the reply function is triggered if the message contains the word \"order\".\n\n3. Human Input Mode Integration\ndef escalate_to_human(message):\n    agent.set_human_input_mode(True)\n    return \"I'm connecting you to a human agent. Please wait...\"\n\nagent.register_reply(trigger=\"escalation\", function=escalate_to_human)\n\nThe agent switches to a human input mode, pausing automated replies until a human responds.\n\n4.

It refers to how messages are exchanged between users and agents, how agents determine when and how to reply, and how human input is handled within the conversation. By mastering chat message flow, developers can design agents that respond intelligently, maintain context, and enable complex interaction patterns.\n\nExplanation\nA conversational agent operates by listening for incoming messages, determining whether it should reply, and generating responses accordingly. The message flow involves several key components:\n\nMessage triggers: Rules or functions that determine when the agent should respond.\nReply functions: Functions registered to handle specific types of messages or triggers.\nHuman input modes: Methods for incorporating user input at various stages of the conversation.\n\n1. Registering and Triggering Reply Functions\nAgents typically use a registration mechanism to associate specific functions with message patterns or triggers. When a message matches a trigger, the corresponding reply function is executed.\nExample triggers:\n\nMessage contains specific keywords (\"help\", \"order status\")\nMessage comes from a particular user role (admin, guest)\nMessage matches a regular expression or intent\n\n2. Controlling Conversation Flow\nBy chaining triggers and reply functions, you can direct the flow of the conversation. You may prompt the user for more information, branch based on user input, or escalate to a human operator.\nConversation flow controls:\n\nConditional branching\nMaintaining conversation state/context\nLooping for clarification or retries\n\n3. Utilizing Human Input Modes\nAgents may need to request specific types of input:\n\nFree-text input: Ask open-ended questions\nChoice selection: Provide options for the user to pick\nFile or media upload: Request images, documents, etc.\n\nThese modes allow agents to handle diverse workflows, from simple Q&A to complex forms.\n\nExamples\nRegistering a Reply Function\ndef on_greeting(message, context):\n    return \"Hello!

They determine when and how the agent pauses for, requests, or processes input from a user, allowing for flexible conversation flows. By configuring human input modes, developers can tailor agent behavior to suit a variety of workflowsâ€”from simple Q&A to complex, multi-turn interactions.\nExplanation\nConversable agents operate by processing messages and generating responses. In many scenarios, agents must interact with human users at specific points in a conversation. Human input modes specify how and when these interactions take place. They influence:\n\nWhen the agent waits for user input.\nHow the agent processes incoming human messages.\nHow the conversation flow is controlled, including triggers and branching.\n\nHuman input modes are typically managed via reply functions and message triggers. A reply function is registered with the agent to handle a specific human input, while message triggers define the conditions under which the agent should request or expect input.\nCommon human input modes include:\n\nPrompted Input: The agent issues a prompt and waits for user input before continuing.\nUnprompted Input: The agent can accept user input at any time, even outside of explicit prompts.\nConditional Input: The agent requests input only if certain conditions are met.\nMulti-step Input: The agent engages in a sequence of prompts, collecting multiple inputs over a conversation.\n\nExample: Prompted Input Mode\nWhen the agent needs information from a user, it can enter a prompted input mode:\ndef ask_for_email(agent, message):\n    agent.prompt(\"Please enter your email address:\")\n    agent.register_reply(\"user_email\", handle_email_input)\n\ndef handle_email_input(agent, message):\n    email = message.text\n    # Validate email here\n    agent.send_message(f\"Thank you!

Tool abstraction involves wrapping these callables in a way that the agent can discover, select, and execute them as needed, often based on user input or internal logic.\nKey aspects of tool abstraction:\n\nWrapping Functions as Tools: Functions are decorated or registered to be discoverable and invocable by the agent.\nDependency Injection: Tools can require external services (such as databases, APIs, or configuration objects).

These tools are callable operationsâ€”such as data queries, web searches, or business logic functionsâ€”that the agent can invoke as needed during its workflow. The toolkit handles the registration of these functions and facilitates dependency injection, allowing agents to access contextual information or shared resources without tight coupling.\nBy wrapping functions as tools and injecting dependencies, you create a modular, maintainable, and extensible system where agents can dynamically compose capabilities to solve complex tasks.\n\nExplanation\nWhat is a Tool?\nA tool is a function or callable that an agent can use to perform specific actions. Tools are typically annotated with metadata (e.g., name, description, input/output schemas) so that agents can reason about which tools to use and how to invoke them.\nWhat is a Toolkit?\nA toolkit is a container or registry for tools.

In the context of agent workflows and toolkits, Depends is used to inject dependencies or contextual information into tool functions dynamically. This enables tools to access resources such as agent memory, configuration, or other services without tight coupling, facilitating modularity, reusability, and testability.\nExplanation\nIn a Conversable Agent Workflow, tools are functions registered to the agent that perform specific tasks. Sometimes, these functions require dependenciesâ€”like access to the agent's context, configuration parameters, or external services. Instead of passing these dependencies manually every time, you can use Depends as a declarative mechanism to specify dependencies, and the agent runtime will resolve and inject them automatically.\nHow Does Depends Work?\n\nDeclaration: You annotate a function argument with Depends, specifying either a dependency function or class.\nResolution: When the tool is invoked, the agent inspects the signature. For each parameter using Depends, it calls the dependency provider (which itself can declare further dependencies), building the required call stack.\nInjection: The resolved values are injected into the tool function transparently.\n\nThis approach is inspired by frameworks like FastAPI and allows for flexible composition of tools and services.\nExamples\nBasic Tool Registration\nfrom agentkit import Agent, Toolkit, tool\n\n@tool\ndef greet(name: str):\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\nInjecting Context via Depends\nSuppose you want your tool to access the agent's current conversation context:\nfrom agentkit import Depends, ConversationContext, tool\n\ndef get_current_context(context: ConversationContext = Depends()):\n    # Return or process the current context as needed\n    return context\n\n@tool\ndef summarize(context: ConversationContext = Depends(get_current_context)):\n    # Use the injected context\n    return f\"Summary of conversation: {context.summary()}\"\n\nWhen summarize is called as a tool, the agent automatically resolves and injects the current conversation context.\nChained Dependencies\nDependencies can themselves depend on other dependencies, enabling complex dependency graphs:\ndef get_database_connection():\n    # Returns a database connection object\n    ...\n\ndef get_user_profile(user_id: str, db=Depends(get_database_connection)):\n    # Fetches user profile using db connection\n    ...\n\n@tool\ndef user_greeting(user_profile=Depends(get_user_profile)):\n    return f\"Welcome, {user_profile['name']}!\"\n\nTool Registration in Toolkits\nYou can bundle tools and their dependencies into a Toolkit:\nclass MyToolkit(Toolkit):\n    @tool\n    def echo(self, message: str):\n        return message\n\n    @tool\n    def agent_status(self, context=Depends()):\n        return f\"Agent is handling: {context.active_task}\"\n\nRegister the toolkit with your agent:\nagent = Agent(toolkits=[MyToolkit()])\n\nBest Practices\n\nKeep functions pure where possible: Use dependency injection to provide external data or services instead of global variables.\nReuse dependencies: Factor out common dependencies as standalone providers to promote reuse.\nDeclare explicit dependencies: Be explicit in your function signatures to make dependencies clear and maintainable.\nAvoid deep dependency chains: Excessively deep or circular dependencies can make debugging difficult.\nDocument dependencies: Clearly document what each dependency provides and why it is needed.\nTest with mocks: Dependency injection makes it easier to substitute dependencies with mock objects during unit testing.\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nConversable Agent Workflow\nToolkit and Tool Registration\nContext Injection\nTool Function Design\nFastAPI Dependency Injection\nInversion of Control\nUnit Testing with Dependency Injection\n\n\nBy leveraging dependency injection with Depends, you can build flexible, maintainable, and testable tools for your Conversable Agent workflows.\n"},"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/context-parameter-injection.html":{"url":"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/context-parameter-injection.html","title":"Context parameter injection","keywords":"","body":"Context parameter injection\nOverview\nContext parameter injection is a powerful pattern in agent workflows that allows dynamic, runtime-provided dataâ€”such as user context, session data, or system resourcesâ€”to be automatically supplied to tool functions invoked by a conversational agent. By leveraging context injection, you can design reusable tool functions that stay decoupled from the underlying agent framework, making dependency management and customization easier and more robust.\nThis approach is essential in agent frameworks that orchestrate tool use, as it enables agents to access up-to-date information or shared resources without hardcoding dependencies or polluting function signatures with unnecessary parameters.\n\nExplanation\nWhat is Context Parameter Injection?\nIn the context of agent toolkits, context parameter injection refers to the automatic provision of context-specific or dependency objects to tool functions at runtime. When an agent calls a tool (a function registered for agent use), the toolkit inspects the function's parameters and, if necessary, injects values from the current context. This is often achieved via parameter names, type annotations, or decorator metadata.\nWhy is it needed?\n\nDecoupling: Tool functions remain focused on their logic, not on fetching dependencies.\nFlexibility: Supports swapping or mocking dependencies for testing.\nExtensibility: New context parameters can be added without refactoring all tools.\n\nHow does it work?\nMost agent toolkits (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI Functions, custom frameworks) implement context injection by:\n\nInspecting function signatures to determine which parameters can/should be injected.\nMatching parameter names/types with available context or dependency providers.\nProviding values for those parameters automatically at invocation time.\n\nFor example, if a tool function accepts a user_id or a db_session parameter, the toolkit can automatically pass these from the current conversational context or dependency registry.\n\nExamples\nBasic Example: Injecting User Context\nSuppose you have a tool function that greets a user by name:\ndef greet_user(user_name: str):\n    return f\"Hello, {user_name}!\"\n\nIf your agent workflow tracks the user_name in its context, you can configure the toolkit to inject it:\n# Pseudo-code for registering the tool with context injection\ntoolkit.register_tool(greet_user)\n\n# When the agent needs to greet, the framework automatically calls:\ngreet_user(user_name=context[\"user_name\"])\n\nAdvanced Example: Injecting Dependencies\nSuppose you have a function that queries a database via a session object:\ndef fetch_user_profile(user_id: str, db_session):\n    return db_session.get_profile(user_id)\n\nYou can declare db_session as a context-injectable dependency:\n# During agent initialization\ntoolkit.register_dependency('db_session', db_session_instance)\ntoolkit.register_tool(fetch_user_profile)\n\n# On invocation:\nfetch_user_profile(user_id=\"123\", db_session=toolkit.resolve('db_session'))\n\nUsing Decorators for Injection\nSome frameworks use decorators for more explicit injection:\nfrom some_agent_framework import tool, inject\n\n@tool\ndef get_weather(location: str, weather_api=inject()):\n    return weather_api.get_forecast(location)\n\nHere, inject() tells the framework to supply the weather_api instance at runtime.\n\nBest Practices\n\nKeep tool function signatures explicit: Clearly define which parameters are to be injected versus those provided by the agent/user.\nAvoid hardcoding dependencies: Rely on context injection rather than global variables or singleton patterns.\nDocument required context parameters: Make it clear which context keys or types are expected for each tool.\nTest tools in isolation: Use mock context/dependencies to ensure tools behave correctly when injected.\nLimit context scope: Only inject what is necessary to avoid leaking sensitive data or increasing coupling.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nName/Type mismatches: Ensure parameter names/types align with what the toolkit/context provides.\nOver-injection: Don't inject more dependencies than neededâ€”keep tools focused.\nSilent failures: Some frameworks may silently ignore missing context, leading to confusing bugs.

By abstracting the details of each LLM provider (OpenAI, Azure, local models, etc.), the ModelClient protocol enables seamless model selection, validation, and invocation across multiple backends. This protocol is essential when building applications that require flexibility in switching or combining LLM providers for tasks such as text generation, chat, or embeddings.\nExplanation\nThe ModelClient protocol typically specifies a set of methods and properties that all LLM client implementations must follow.

This allows for:\n\nState Persistence: Agents can reference what has happened previously.\nDynamic Decision Making: Flows can branch or loop based on context.\nData Passing: Outputs from one agent can be inputs to another.\n\nHow Context Variables Work\n\nInitialization: Variables are set at the start of the workflow or dynamically during execution.\nAccess and Modification: Any agent in the workflow can read or update context variables.\nConditional Logic: Transitions between agents or workflow branches can use expressions evaluating context variables.\n\nExample Use Cases\n\nTrack user preferences or session data.\nStore results from API calls for later use.\nDecide next agent or action based on status codes or flags.\n\nExamples\n1. Storing and Updating Variables\n# YAML-like workflow definition\ncontext:\n  user_name: null\n  order_status: null\n\nagents:\n  - id: get_user_info\n    action: fetch_user\n    on_complete:\n      set:\n        user_name: $result.name\n\n  - id: process_order\n    action: process_order\n    on_complete:\n      set:\n        order_status: $result.status\n\n2. Conditional Logic for Transitions\ntransitions:\n  - from: process_order\n    to: notify_success\n    condition: context.order_status == \"success\"\n\n  - from: process_order\n    to: notify_failure\n    condition: context.order_status != \"success\"\n\nIn this example, the workflow checks the order_status context variable to determine which notification agent to run.\n3.

AvailableCondition is a specialized form used to control agent or tool availability based on context.\n\nExplanation\nContext Variables\nContext variables are shared data accessible to all agents within a workflow. They are typically updated as agents execute tasks, enabling downstream agents to react to prior outcomes.\nContextCondition\nA ContextCondition is an expression that references one or more context variables, evaluated at runtime. It is used to:\n\nGate agent transitions (e.g., only proceed if task_completed == true)\nTrigger specific actions based on workflow state\nImplement branching and loop logic\n\nSyntax:ContextCondition expressions are usually written in a domain-specific language or Python-like syntax, referencing context variables directly.\nExample:\ncondition: context['user_verified'] == True and context['attempts'] \nAvailableCondition\nAn AvailableCondition determines whether a particular agent, tool, or resource should be considered \"available\" for selection or execution, based on the current context.\nExample:\navailable_condition: context.get('document_uploaded', False)\n\nThis would make the agent available only if a document has been uploaded.\nEvaluating Conditions\nBoth ContextCondition and AvailableCondition are evaluated against the current state of the context.

They allow you to encode conditional logic that evaluates context variables and determines agent behavior or routing within a multi-agent system. By leveraging these constructs, orchestration can adapt to changing context, user input, or external signals, enabling more flexible and intelligent workflows.\n\nExplanation\nOnCondition and OnContextCondition are used to control the flow of execution in multi-agent workflows based on evaluated conditions:\n\nOnCondition: Triggers a transition or action when a specified boolean expression or condition is met. The condition may reference current context variables, agent states, or external inputs.\nOnContextCondition: Similar to OnCondition, but specifically focuses on expressions that involve context variables, such as user state, workflow progress, or shared memory between agents.\n\nContext variables are key-value pairs stored in a workflow's context object. They allow agents to share information, track progress, or store temporary results. By updating and evaluating these variables, agents can influence each other's behavior and orchestrate complex, adaptive flows.\nHow it Works\n\nStoring Context Variables: Agents or orchestrators set and update context variables during execution.\nDefining Conditions: Conditions are expressed using a supported expression language (e.g., Python, Jinja, JSONata, or custom DSL).\nEvaluating Conditions: The orchestrator evaluates the condition at runtime; if it returns true, the specified transition or action is executed.\nFlow Control: This enables branching, looping, or early exits from workflows, depending on context.\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Conditional Agent Routing\n# Pseudocode for a workflow definition\nsteps:\n  - id: gather_user_info\n    agent: UserInfoAgent\n    on_complete:\n      - action: set_context\n        key: user_age\n        value: \"{{ output.age }}\"\n      - action: go_to\n        step: age_check\n\n  - id: age_check\n    on_context_condition:\n      condition: \"{{ context.user_age >= 18 }}\"\n      next_step: adult_flow\n    else:\n      next_step: minor_flow\n\n  - id: adult_flow\n    agent: AdultServicesAgent\n    ...\n\n  - id: minor_flow\n    agent: MinorServicesAgent\n    ...\n\nExplanation:  \n\nAfter gathering user info, the workflow stores the user's age in a context variable.\non_context_condition checks the age and routes the flow to either adult_flow or minor_flow accordingly.\n\n\nExample 2: Looping Until a Condition is Met\n# Pseudocode for an agent loop using OnCondition\n\nwhile not context[\"done\"]:\n    agent_output = SomeAgent.act(context)\n    context[\"done\"] = agent_output[\"is_complete\"]\n    if context[\"done\"]:\n        break\n\nExplanation:  \n\nThe agent continues to run until the \"done\" context variable is set to True by agent output.\n\n\nExample 3: Using OnCondition for Error Handling\n- id: process_payment\n  agent: PaymentAgent\n  on_condition:\n    condition: \"{{ output.success == false }}\"\n    next_step: handle_payment_error\n  else:\n    next_step: confirm_order\n\nExplanation:  \n\nIf payment fails (output.success == false), the workflow transitions to an error handler; otherwise, it confirms the order.\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nKeep Conditions Simple: Complex logic can become hard to maintain; try to encapsulate logic in well-named context variables.\nType Safety: Ensure context variables are properly typed and initialized to avoid runtime errors.\nDocument Context Usage: Clearly document which agents set, read, or modify specific context variables.\nAvoid Circular Dependencies: Be careful when agents depend on variables set by others in the same step or cycle.\nTest Conditions: Write tests for branching logic to ensure all paths are covered and conditions behave as expected.\nGraceful Failure: Always provide fallback paths (e.g., else branches) for conditions that may not be met.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nContext Variables\nAgent Transition Management\nExpression Languages for Orchestration\nError Handling in Workflows\nAdvanced Agent Orchestration (Prerequisite)\nLooping and Iterative Flows\n\nFor more information on multi-agent workflows, see Multi-Agent Workflows.\n"},"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/contextexpression.html":{"url":"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/contextexpression.html","title":"ContextExpression","keywords":"","body":"ContextExpression\nOverview\nA ContextExpression is a feature in advanced agent orchestration that allows workflows to dynamically reference, evaluate, and manipulate context variables.

This process involves configuring the LLM to recognize tool calls, formatting responses for downstream consumption, and managing the full message flow between user, model, and tools.\n\nExplanation\n1. Defining and Registering Functions\nTo enable LLMs to call functions, each function (or \"tool\") must be registered with a schema that defines its name, description, and parameters using JSON Schema. This schema informs the model about what functions are available, their arguments, and how to format calls.\nExample schema:\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n  \"description\": \"Retrieve current weather information for a city.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"city\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Name of the city\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"city\"]\n  }\n}\n\n2. Configuring Structured Outputs\nWhen configured for structured outputs, the LLM returns a special output format (often as a JSON object or via a specific message protocol).

Practices\n\nDefine clear, unambiguous schemas: Use descriptive names and parameter descriptions to help the LLM choose and populate tools correctly.\nValidate input and output: Always validate that the LLM's tool call arguments match your schema before invoking a function.\nHandle errors gracefully: Prepare for missing or malformed arguments, tool failures, or ambiguous LLM responses.\nLimit tool exposure: Only register functions that should be accessible to the model to minimize risk.\nChain tool calls carefully: If using multiple tools or multi-step reasoning, manage message state and context explicitly.\nMonitor usage: Log tool calls and monitor for unexpected or malicious use.\nVersion your schemas: If your function signatures change, version them to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nStructured Outputs with LLMs  \nLLM Configuration and Model Clients\nTools and Dependency Injection\nFunction Calling in OpenAI API\nJSON Schema\nPrompt

Handling\nTesting and Logging\nAdvanced Agent Orchestration\nContext Variables\nState Management\n\nOverview\nWhen building multi-agent systems that execute codeâ€”whether running user-generated scripts, invoking APIs, or using external toolsâ€”security becomes a critical concern. Unrestricted code execution can expose your system to attacks such as code injection, privilege escalation, data leakage, and denial of service. This chapter addresses common security pitfalls and presents best practices for securely handling code execution in agent workflows.\n\nExplanation\nWhy is Code Execution Risky?\nMulti-agent systems often automate complex workflows, sometimes allowing dynamic or user-supplied code execution. Without proper safeguards, this can lead to:\n\nUnauthorized Access: Malicious code could access sensitive files or data.\nSystem Compromise: Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to gain control over the host system.\nResource Exhaustion: Poorly written or malicious scripts can consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk resources.\nData Leakage: Sensitive information may be inadvertently exposed to unauthorized parties.\n\nKey Attack Vectors\n\nCode Injection: Unsanitized input leads to execution of unintended commands.\nInsecure Dependencies: Third-party libraries or tools may introduce vulnerabilities.\nImproper Permissions: Running agents with excessive privileges increases risk.\nLack of Monitoring: Without logging, attacks or misuse can go undetected.\n\nExample Scenario\nSuppose an agent accepts Python code snippets to automate data analysis. If user input isn't properly validated, an attacker could submit:\nimport os\nos.system('rm -rf /')\n\nIf executed as-is, this command could delete critical system files.\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Unsafe Code Execution\nBad Practice:\n# Dangerous: Directly executing user-supplied code\nuser_code = input(\"Enter Python code: \")\nexec(user_code)  # Do not use!\n\nRisks:\n\nArbitrary code execution\nData exfiltration or system compromise\n\n\nExample 2: Safer Code Execution with Sandboxing\nBetter Practice:\nimport subprocess\n\ndef safe_run_script(code: str):\n    # Write code to a temporary file\n    with open('/tmp/user_code.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(code)\n    # Execute in a restricted subprocess\n    result = subprocess.run(\n        ['python3', '/tmp/user_code.py'],\n        timeout=5,\n        capture_output=True,\n        check=False\n    )\n    return result.stdout[-1000:]  # Limit output size\n\n# Example usage\nuser_code = \"print('Hello, world!')\"\nprint(safe_run_script(user_code))\n\nImprovements:\n\nRuns code in a separate process\nTimeout limits execution time\nOutput size is restricted\n\n\nExample 3: Using Containers for Isolation\n# Run user code in a Docker container with limited resources and no network access\ndocker run --rm -m 128m --cpus=0.5 --network=none -v $(pwd)/user_code.py:/usr/src/app/code.py python:3.9 python code.py\n\nBenefits:\n\nLimits CPU and memory usage\nPrevents network access\nProvides filesystem isolation\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nInput Validation: Never execute code or commands from unsanitized input.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege: Run agents and subprocesses with the minimal required permissions. Avoid running as root.\nSandboxing: Execute user code in isolated environments (e.g., containers, VMs, or restricted interpreters).\nResource Limiting: Set strict timeouts, memory, and CPU limits for code execution.\nDependency Management: Use trusted libraries and monitor for security updates.\nLogging and Monitoring: Log all code executions, inputs, and outputs. Monitor for unusual behavior or resource usage.\nDisable Dangerous Functions: Restrict or sandbox access to filesystem, system calls, and network functions where possible.\nRegular Audits: Review code and configurations regularly for security issues.\nError Handling: Never expose stack traces or sensitive error information to untrusted users.\n\nCommon Pitfalls\n\nDirectly using eval or exec on user input\nRunning code with administrator privileges\nIgnoring failed subprocesses or missing timeouts\nOmitting audit logs for executed code\n\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with code execution in multi-agent workflows and build more secure and resilient systems.\n"},"chapters/practical-pitfalls-and-best-practices/testing-and-logging-strategies.html":{"url":"chapters/practical-pitfalls-and-best-practices/testing-and-logging-strategies.html","title":"Testing and logging strategies","keywords":"","body":"Testing and Logging Strategies\nComprehensive testing and logging are essential for maintaining agent systems.\nRelated Concepts\n\nError Handling\nSecurity Considerations\nAdvanced Agent Orchestration\nContext Variables\nState Management\n\n"}}}
