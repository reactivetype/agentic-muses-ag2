It specifies how agents send and receive messages, process events, and maintain consistent interactionsâ€”allowing for scalable, modular, and flexible software architectures. Agent protocols are foundational in multi-agent systems, distributed computing, and modern AI frameworks.\nExplanation\nAt its core, the agent protocol dictates how agents interact:\n\nMessage Structure: Defines how information is packaged for communication.\nAgent Classes: Different types of agents (e.g., reactive, proactive, hybrid) may implement the protocol differently.\nEvent Handling: Outlines how agents respond to internal or external events.\n\nAgents\nAn agent is an autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking actions to achieve goals. In Python, an agent is often modeled as a class with methods for handling messages and events.\nMessages\nMessages are structured data objects exchanged between agents. Each message usually includes:\n\nSender: The agent initiating communication.\nReceiver: The intended recipient agent.\nType: The kind of message (e.g., request, response, inform).\nPayload: The content or data being communicated.\n\nEvents\nAn event represents a significant change or occurrence in the system (e.g., a timer fires, a resource state changes). Agents are typically designed to handle events either synchronously or asynchronously.\nAgent Protocol Interface\nA typical agent protocol provides:\n\nMethods for sending/receiving messages\nEvent handling mechanisms\nLifecycle management (start, stop, etc.)\n\nExample Protocol in Python (Pseudo-code):\nclass AgentProtocol:\n    def send(self, message):\n        \"\"\"Send a message to another agent\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def receive(self):\n        \"\"\"Receive a message from another agent\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        \"\"\"Process an incoming event\"\"\"\n        pass\n\nExamples\n1.

By registering reply functions, developers can specify how an agent should react to specific message types, content, or triggers during a conversation. This process allows for modular, maintainable, and context-aware conversation flows, supporting both automated responses and integrating human input where necessary.\n\nExplanation\nIn a conversable agent workflow, reply functions are callbacks or handlers that the agent invokes in response to certain messages or triggers. Registration is the process of associating these functions with specific message patterns, types, or conditions.\nHow it works:\n\nAn agent maintains a registry (often a mapping or list) of reply functions and their associated triggers.\nWhen a message is received, the agent scans the registry to determine if any function should be triggered based on the message's characteristics (e.g., type, intent, content).\nIf a match is found, the corresponding function is executed, producing a reply or initiating an action.\nReply functions can be chained or composed to build complex conversational workflows, including branching, loops, and human-in-the-loop steps.\n\nHuman input modes:Agents can be configured to switch between automated reply functions and modes that solicit human input (e.g., pausing for a human operator to respond), allowing for hybrid workflows.\n\nExamples\n1. Basic Reply Function Registration\ndef greet(message):\n    return \"Hello! How can I help you today?\"\n\nagent.register_reply(trigger=\"greeting\", function=greet)\n\nWhen a message with the type or intent \"greeting\" arrives, the greet function is called.\n\n2.

It refers to how messages are exchanged between users and agents, how agents determine when and how to reply, and how human input is handled within the conversation. By mastering chat message flow, developers can design agents that respond intelligently, maintain context, and enable complex interaction patterns.\n\nExplanation\nA conversational agent operates by listening for incoming messages, determining whether it should reply, and generating responses accordingly. The message flow involves several key components:\n\nMessage triggers: Rules or functions that determine when the agent should respond.\nReply functions: Functions registered to handle specific types of messages or triggers.\nHuman input modes: Methods for incorporating user input at various stages of the conversation.\n\n1. Registering and Triggering Reply Functions\nAgents typically use a registration mechanism to associate specific functions with message patterns or triggers. When a message matches a trigger, the corresponding reply function is executed.\nExample triggers:\n\nMessage contains specific keywords (\"help\", \"order status\")\nMessage comes from a particular user role (admin, guest)\nMessage matches a regular expression or intent\n\n2. Controlling Conversation Flow\nBy chaining triggers and reply functions, you can direct the flow of the conversation. You may prompt the user for more information, branch based on user input, or escalate to a human operator.\nConversation flow controls:\n\nConditional branching\nMaintaining conversation state/context\nLooping for clarification or retries\n\n3. Utilizing Human Input Modes\nAgents may need to request specific types of input:\n\nFree-text input: Ask open-ended questions\nChoice selection: Provide options for the user to pick\nFile or media upload: Request images, documents, etc.\n\nThese modes allow agents to handle diverse workflows, from simple Q&A to complex forms.\n\nExamples\nRegistering a Reply Function\ndef on_greeting(message, context):\n    return \"Hello!

A reply function is registered with the agent to handle a specific human input, while message triggers define the conditions under which the agent should request or expect input.\nCommon human input modes include:\n\nPrompted Input: The agent issues a prompt and waits for user input before continuing.\nUnprompted Input: The agent can accept user input at any time, even outside of explicit prompts.\nConditional Input: The agent requests input only if certain conditions are met.\nMulti-step Input: The agent engages in a sequence of prompts, collecting multiple inputs over a conversation.\n\nExample: Prompted Input Mode\nWhen the agent needs information from a user, it can enter a prompted input mode:\ndef ask_for_email(agent, message):\n    agent.prompt(\"Please enter your email address:\")\n    agent.register_reply(\"user_email\", handle_email_input)\n\ndef handle_email_input(agent, message):\n    email = message.text\n    # Validate email here\n    agent.send_message(f\"Thank you! We received your email: {email}\")\n\nMessage Triggers & Reply Functions\nReply functions are registered with specific triggers (such as message types, intent, or keywords). When a message matching a trigger arrives, the associated reply function is executed.\nagent.register_trigger(\"greeting\", handle_greeting)\n\ndef handle_greeting(agent, message):\n    agent.send_message(\"Hello! How can I help you today?\")\n    agent.register_reply(\"user_request\", handle_request)\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Simple Prompted Input\ndef start_registration(agent, message):\n    agent.send_message(\"Welcome! Let's get started.\")\n    agent.prompt(\"What's your name?\")\n    agent.register_reply(\"user_name\", handle_name)\n\ndef handle_name(agent, message):\n    user_name = message.text\n    agent.send_message(f\"Nice to meet you, {user_name}!\")\n\nExample 2: Multi-step Input with Validation\ndef ask_for_age(agent, message):\n    agent.prompt(\"How old are you?\")\n    agent.register_reply(\"user_age\", handle_age)\n\ndef handle_age(agent, message):\n    try:\n        age = int(message.text)\n        if age \nExample 3: Unprompted Input Handling\ndef handle_any_message(agent, message):\n    if \"help\" in message.text.lower():\n        agent.send_message(\"Sure, how can I assist you?\")\n    else:\n        agent.send_message(\"I'm here if you need anything.\")\n\nagent.register_trigger(\"any_message\", handle_any_message)\n\nBest Practices\n\nExplicitly register reply functions: Always pair prompts with reply handlers to avoid unhandled input.\nValidate and sanitize user input: Never assume user input is correct; always check and handle errors gracefully.\nAvoid dead-ends: Ensure every prompt and input mode leads to a clear next step or fallback.\nSupport interruption and correction: Allow users to correct their input or change the flow if needed.\nUse clear prompts: Make it obvious to the user when input is expected and what format is required.\nDecouple triggers and handlers: Keep message triggers and reply functions modular for easier maintenance.\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgents and Messages\nReply Functions\nMessage Triggers\nConversation Flow Control\nError Handling in Conversable Agents\n\nFor more in-depth information, see the Foundations of Agents and Messages chapter.\n"},"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/":{"url":"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/","title":"Tools and Dependency Injection","keywords":"","body":"Tools and Dependency Injection\nLeveraging tools and dependency injection for agent extensibility\nPrerequisites\n\nConversable Agent Workflow\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nWrap functions as tools for agent use\nInject dependencies and context into functions\nUnderstand the toolkit and tool registration mechanisms\n\nSections\n\nTool abstraction\nToolkit\nDependency injection with Depends\nContext parameter injection\n\n"},"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/tool-abstraction.html":{"url":"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/tool-abstraction.html","title":"Tool Abstraction","keywords":"","body":"Tool abstraction\nOverview\nTool abstraction is a pattern that encapsulates functions or methods as \"tools\" that can be invoked by an agent within a workflow, such as a conversable agent.

These tools are callable operationsâ€”such as data queries, web searches, or business logic functionsâ€”that the agent can invoke as needed during its workflow. The toolkit handles the registration of these functions and facilitates dependency injection, allowing agents to access contextual information or shared resources without tight coupling.\nBy wrapping functions as tools and injecting dependencies, you create a modular, maintainable, and extensible system where agents can dynamically compose capabilities to solve complex tasks.\n\nExplanation\nWhat is a Tool?\nA tool is a function or callable that an agent can use to perform specific actions. Tools are typically annotated with metadata (e.g., name, description, input/output schemas) so that agents can reason about which tools to use and how to invoke them.\nWhat is a Toolkit?\nA toolkit is a container or registry for tools. It manages:\n\nTool registration: Adding, removing, and listing available tools.\nDependency injection: Supplying tools with the required context or resources at runtime.\nInterface abstraction: Presenting a unified interface for agent workflows.\n\nDependency Injection in Toolkits\nDependency injection enables you to write functions that require certain resources or context (e.g., a database connection, user session, configuration).

In the context of agent workflows and toolkits, Depends is used to inject dependencies or contextual information into tool functions dynamically. This enables tools to access resources such as agent memory, configuration, or other services without tight coupling, facilitating modularity, reusability, and testability.\nExplanation\nIn a Conversable Agent Workflow, tools are functions registered to the agent that perform specific tasks. Sometimes, these functions require dependenciesâ€”like access to the agentâ€™s context, configuration parameters, or external services. Instead of passing these dependencies manually every time, you can use Depends as a declarative mechanism to specify dependencies, and the agent runtime will resolve and inject them automatically.\nHow Does Depends Work?\n\nDeclaration: You annotate a function argument with Depends, specifying either a dependency function or class.\nResolution: When the tool is invoked, the agent inspects the signature. For each parameter using Depends, it calls the dependency provider (which itself can declare further dependencies), building the required call stack.\nInjection: The resolved values are injected into the tool function transparently.\n\nThis approach is inspired by frameworks like FastAPI and allows for flexible composition of tools and services.\nExamples\nBasic Tool Registration\nfrom agentkit import Agent, Toolkit, tool\n\n@tool\ndef greet(name: str):\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\nInjecting Context via Depends\nSuppose you want your tool to access the agent's current conversation context:\nfrom agentkit import Depends, ConversationContext, tool\n\ndef get_current_context(context: ConversationContext = Depends()):\n    # Return or process the current context as needed\n    return context\n\n@tool\ndef summarize(context: ConversationContext = Depends(get_current_context)):\n    # Use the injected context\n    return f\"Summary of conversation: {context.summary()}\"\n\nWhen summarize is called as a tool, the agent automatically resolves and injects the current conversation context.\nChained Dependencies\nDependencies can themselves depend on other dependencies, enabling complex dependency graphs:\ndef get_database_connection():\n    # Returns a database connection object\n    ...\n\ndef get_user_profile(user_id: str, db=Depends(get_database_connection)):\n    # Fetches user profile using db connection\n    ...\n\n@tool\ndef user_greeting(user_profile=Depends(get_user_profile)):\n    return f\"Welcome, {user_profile['name']}!\"\n\nTool Registration in Toolkits\nYou can bundle tools and their dependencies into a Toolkit:\nclass MyToolkit(Toolkit):\n    @tool\n    def echo(self, message: str):\n        return message\n\n    @tool\n    def agent_status(self, context=Depends()):\n        return f\"Agent is handling: {context.active_task}\"\n\nRegister the toolkit with your agent:\nagent = Agent(toolkits=[MyToolkit()])\n\nBest Practices\n\nKeep functions pure where possible: Use dependency injection to provide external data or services instead of global variables.\nReuse dependencies: Factor out common dependencies as standalone providers to promote reuse.\nDeclare explicit dependencies: Be explicit in your function signatures to make dependencies clear and maintainable.\nAvoid deep dependency chains: Excessively deep or circular dependencies can make debugging difficult.\nDocument dependencies: Clearly document what each dependency provides and why it is needed.\nTest with mocks: Dependency injection makes it easier to substitute dependencies with mock objects during unit testing.\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nConversable Agent Workflow\nToolkit and Tool Registration\nContext Injection\nTool Function Design\nFastAPI Dependency Injection\nInversion of Control\nUnit Testing with Dependency Injection\n\n\nBy leveraging dependency injection with Depends, you can build flexible, maintainable, and testable tools for your Conversable Agent workflows.\n"},"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/context-parameter-injection.html":{"url":"chapters/tools-and-dependency-injection/context-parameter-injection.html","title":"Context Parameter Injection","keywords":"","body":"Context parameter injection\nOverview\nContext parameter injection is a powerful pattern in agent workflows that allows dynamic, runtime-provided dataâ€”such as user context, session data, or system resourcesâ€”to be automatically supplied to tool functions invoked by a conversational agent. By leveraging context injection, you can design reusable tool functions that stay decoupled from the underlying agent framework, making dependency management and customization easier and more robust.\nThis approach is essential in agent frameworks that orchestrate tool use, as it enables agents to access up-to-date information or shared resources without hardcoding dependencies or polluting function signatures with unnecessary parameters.\n\nExplanation\nWhat is Context Parameter Injection?\nIn the context of agent toolkits, context parameter injection refers to the automatic provision of context-specific or dependency objects to tool functions at runtime. When an agent calls a tool (a function registered for agent use), the toolkit inspects the function's parameters and, if necessary, injects values from the current context. This is often achieved via parameter names, type annotations, or decorator metadata.\nWhy is it needed?\n\nDecoupling: Tool functions remain focused on their logic, not on fetching dependencies.\nFlexibility: Supports swapping or mocking dependencies for testing.\nExtensibility: New context parameters can be added without refactoring all tools.\n\nHow does it work?\nMost agent toolkits (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI Functions, custom frameworks) implement context injection by:\n\nInspecting function signatures to determine which parameters can/should be injected.\nMatching parameter names/types with available context or dependency providers.\nProviding values for those parameters automatically at invocation time.\n\nFor example, if a tool function accepts a user_id or a db_session parameter, the toolkit can automatically pass these from the current conversational context or dependency registry.\n\nExamples\nBasic Example: Injecting User Context\nSuppose you have a tool function that greets a user by name:\ndef greet_user(user_name: str):\n    return f\"Hello, {user_name}!\"\n\nIf your agent workflow tracks the user_name in its context, you can configure the toolkit to inject it:\n# Pseudo-code for registering the tool with context injection\ntoolkit.register_tool(greet_user)\n\n# When the agent needs to greet, the framework automatically calls:\ngreet_user(user_name=context[\"user_name\"])\n\nAdvanced Example: Injecting Dependencies\nSuppose you have a function that queries a database via a session object:\ndef fetch_user_profile(user_id: str, db_session):\n    return db_session.get_profile(user_id)\n\nYou can declare db_session as a context-injectable dependency:\n# During agent initialization\ntoolkit.register_dependency('db_session', db_session_instance)\ntoolkit.register_tool(fetch_user_profile)\n\n# On invocation:\nfetch_user_profile(user_id=\"123\", db_session=toolkit.resolve('db_session'))\n\nUsing Decorators for Injection\nSome frameworks use decorators for more explicit injection:\nfrom some_agent_framework import tool, inject\n\n@tool\ndef get_weather(location: str, weather_api=inject()):\n    return weather_api.get_forecast(location)\n\nHere, inject() tells the framework to supply the weather_api instance at runtime.\n\nBest Practices\n\nKeep tool function signatures explicit: Clearly define which parameters are to be injected versus those provided by the agent/user.\nAvoid hardcoding dependencies: Rely on context injection rather than global variables or singleton patterns.\nDocument required context parameters: Make it clear which context keys or types are expected for each tool.\nTest tools in isolation: Use mock context/dependencies to ensure tools behave correctly when injected.\nLimit context scope: Only inject what is necessary to avoid leaking sensitive data or increasing coupling.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nName/Type mismatches: Ensure parameter names/types align with what the toolkit/context provides.\nOver-injection: Don't inject more dependencies than neededâ€”keep tools focused.\nSilent failures: Some frameworks may silently ignore missing context, leading to confusing bugs.

This protocol is essential when building applications that require flexibility in switching or combining LLM providers for tasks such as text generation, chat, or embeddings.\nExplanation\nThe ModelClient protocol typically specifies a set of methods and properties that all LLM client implementations must follow. This abstraction allows you to:\n\nConfigure LLMs using objects like LLMConfig and configuration lists.\nSelect and validate which backend or model client to use based on runtime context or application needs.\nFilter and manage multiple configurations, enabling multi-backend support (e.g., failover, routing, or A/B testing).\n\nKey Components\n\nLLMConfig:A configuration object that holds model parameters (model name, API key, base URL, etc.) relevant to a specific backend.\n\nModelClient (Protocol/Base Class):An interface that defines methods such as generate, validate, and get_config.\n\nDependency Injection:Model clients are often instantiated via dependency injection, allowing for flexible swapping and testing.\n\nConfig Lists:Collections of LLMConfig objects, enabling dynamic selection and management of available models.\n\n\nTypical Protocol Methods\nfrom typing import Protocol, Any, Dict\n\nclass ModelClient(Protocol):\n    def generate(self, prompt: str, config: 'LLMConfig') -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate text based on the prompt and configuration.\"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    def validate(self, config: 'LLMConfig') -> bool:\n        \"\"\"Check if the configuration is valid for this client.\"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    def get_config(self) -> 'LLMConfig':\n        \"\"\"Return the current LLM configuration.\"\"\"\n        ...\n\nThis allows consumers to use any compliant model client interchangeably within the application.\nExamples\n1.

To manage these, you use LLM configuration objects (LLMConfig) and organize them into config lists. Filtering allows you to select, validate, and manage which models or model clients are active based on your requirements or runtime conditions. This enables dynamic backend support, simplifies dependency injection, and makes multi-model orchestration robust and maintainable.\n\nExplanation\nLLMConfig and Config Lists\n\nLLMConfig: A structured object or class encapsulating the settings needed to instantiate and operate an LLM. This might include model name, API keys, endpoint URLs, and backend type.\nConfig List: An iterable collection (list, tuple, etc.) of LLMConfig instances. This allows you to enumerate all available LLMs, regardless of their backend.\n\nExample:\nclass LLMConfig:\n    def __init__(self, name, backend, api_key=None, endpoint=None):\n        self.name = name\n        self.backend = backend\n        self.api_key = api_key\n        self.endpoint = endpoint\n\nconfig_list = [\n    LLMConfig(name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", backend=\"openai\", api_key=\"sk-...\"),\n    LLMConfig(name=\"llama-2-7b\", backend=\"huggingface\", endpoint=\"http://localhost:8000\"),\n    LLMConfig(name=\"azure-gpt4\", backend=\"azure\", api_key=\"az-...\", endpoint=\"https://azure.openai.com/\"),\n]\n\nFiltering Config Lists\nFiltering refers to selecting configurations that match certain criteria (e.g., backend type, model name, or feature support). This is essential for:\n\nDependency injection: Providing only the relevant model to a component.\nMulti-backend support: Choosing the best available backend at runtime.\nValidation: Ensuring only valid/working configs are used.\n\nFiltering Example\ndef filter_configs(config_list, backend=None, name=None):\n    return [\n        config for config in config_list\n        if (backend is None or config.backend == backend)\n        and (name is None or config.name == name)\n    ]\n\n# Filter for OpenAI models\nopenai_configs = filter_configs(config_list, backend=\"openai\")\n\nModel Client Selection and Validation\nOnce filtered, configs are instantiated as model clients. Validation may include checking API connectivity, credentials, or supported features.\ndef validate_config(config):\n    # Simple validation example\n    if config.backend == \"openai\" and not config.api_key:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Missing API key for {config.name}\")\n    # Add backend-specific checks...\n    return True\n\nvalid_configs = [c for c in openai_configs if validate_config(c)]\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Basic Config List and Filtering\nconfig_list = [\n    LLMConfig(\"gpt-4\", \"openai\", api_key=\"...\"),\n    LLMConfig(\"llama-13b\", \"huggingface\", endpoint=\"http://localhost:8000\"),\n    LLMConfig(\"gpt-35\", \"azure\", api_key=\"...\", endpoint=\"https://az.openai.com\"),\n]\n\n# Get only HuggingFace configs\nhf_configs = filter_configs(config_list, backend=\"huggingface\")\nfor cfg in hf_configs:\n    print(cfg.name)  # Output: llama-13b\n\nExample 2: Dependency Injection for a Service\nclass SummarizerService:\n    def __init__(self, llm_client):\n        self.llm_client = llm_client\n\n# Select and validate an OpenAI client\nopenai_config = filter_configs(config_list, backend=\"openai\")[0]\nvalidate_config(openai_config)\nsummarizer = SummarizerService(llm_client=openai_config)\n\nExample 3: Dynamic Multi-Backend Orchestration\ndef get_best_available_llm(config_list):\n    # Prioritize OpenAI, fallback to others\n    for backend in [\"openai\", \"azure\", \"huggingface\"]:\n        candidates = filter_configs(config_list, backend=backend)\n        for config in candidates:\n            try:\n                validate_config(config)\n                return config\n            except Exception:\n                continue\n    raise RuntimeError(\"No valid LLM configuration available.\")\n\nllm_config = get_best_available_llm(config_list)\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nCentralize Configuration: Keep all LLM settings in one place for easier management.\nUse Filtering Functions: Always filter configs based on backend, model, or feature needs.\nValidate Early: Validate configs before using them to avoid runtime failures.\nAbstract Model Clients: Interact with LLMs via client classes that wrap configs for dependency injection.\nSupport Fallbacks: Always consider fallback strategies for multi-backend robustness.\nDocument Config Structure: Clearly document what each config field means and which are required for each backend.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nNot validating API keys or endpoints before use.\nHardcoding selection logic instead of using flexible filters.\nMixing config and client instantiation logic, leading to tight coupling.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nTools and Dependency Injection\nLLMConfig Usage Patterns\nModel Client Abstraction\nMulti-backend Orchestration\nError Handling and Validation for LLMs\n\nFor further reading:\n\nDependency Injection Patterns in Python\nOpenAI API Best Practices\nHuggingFace Transformers Documentation\n\n\nThis documentation outlines how to use config lists and filtering to enable robust, scalable, and maintainable LLM integration across multiple backends.\n"},"chapters/advanced-agent-orchestration/":{"url":"chapters/advanced-agent-orchestration/","title":"Advanced Agent Orchestration","keywords":"","body":"Advanced Agent Orchestration\nManaging multi-agent conversations and group chat patterns\nPrerequisites\n\nLLM Configuration and Model Clients\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nSet up group chats with different orchestration patterns\nCustomize speaker selection and agent transitions\nApply handoff and after work transitions\n\nSections\n\nGroupChat and GroupChatManager\nPatterns for orchestration (Auto, Manual, RoundRobin, Random).md)\nSpeaker selection methods\nTransitionTarget and handoff conditions\n\n"},"chapters/advanced-agent-orchestration/groupchat-and-groupchatmanager.html":{"url":"chapters/advanced-agent-orchestration/groupchat-and-groupchatmanager.html","title":"GroupChat and GroupChatManager","keywords":"","body":"GroupChat and GroupChatManager\nOverview\nGroupChat and GroupChatManager are advanced abstractions for orchestrating multiple agents in collaborative conversational workflows. They enable you to coordinate interactions among multiple language model agents within a single conversation, supporting complex patterns such as multi-agent discussions, dynamic speaker selection, and intelligent handoffs. These constructs are essential for building robust, multi-faceted AI systems where agents with different roles and expertise work together toward a shared goal.\n\nExplanation\nWhat is GroupChat?\nA GroupChat is a structured conversation involving multiple agents (LLMs or tool-augmented agents). Unlike a single-agent chat, GroupChat manages the flow of messages, tracks speaker turns, and maintains conversation state across agents. It enables orchestration patterns such as round-robin discussion, expert handoff, and consensus building.\nWhat is GroupChatManager?\nThe GroupChatManager acts as the conductor of the GroupChat. It controls which agent should speak next, manages transitions (including handoffs and after-work transitions), and enforces orchestration policies. The manager can be customized to implement various decision logic for speaker selection and agent transitions based on context, agent capabilities, or conversation history.\nKey Features\n\nSpeaker Selection: Dynamically choose which agent responds at each turn based on context or predefined rules.\nAgent Transitions: Seamlessly transition between agents, allowing for task-specific handoff or multi-step collaboration.\nOrchestration Patterns: Implement patterns such as round-robin, expert-in-the-loop, or conditional delegation.\nState Management: Maintain shared context and message history across all agents in the group.\n\n\nExamples\n1.

Proper speaker selection is essential for enabling effective collaboration, coherent task execution, and seamless transitions between agents in complex conversations or workflows. These methods can be rule-based, probabilistic, or context-aware, and are often customized to fit specific orchestration patterns such as handoff, round-robin, or dynamic role assignment.\n\nExplanation\nIn multi-agent systems, \"agents\" can represent different LLMs, specialized bots, or user personas. When orchestrating a group chat, the system must decide which agent should \"speak\" next. The speaker selection method governs this decision, ensuring that:\n\nThe right agent handles the right part of the conversation\nThe flow of conversation remains logical and efficient\nAgents can hand off tasks or provide after-action summaries as needed\n\nCommon Speaker Selection Patterns:\n\nRound-robin: Each agent takes turns in a fixed sequence, regardless of context.\nRole-based: The next speaker is chosen based on predefined roles or expertise (e.g., technical expert, project manager).\nTrigger-based: Specific keywords, intents, or actions trigger a handoff to a particular agent.\nContext-aware: The system analyzes conversation context, history, and goals to dynamically select the most appropriate agent.\nManual override: A user or supervisor explicitly selects the next speaker.\n\nTransitions:\n\nHandoff: An agent passes control to another agent, often mid-task. Useful for dividing complex workflows.\nAfter work: An agent provides a summary, validation, or follow-up after another agent completes their part.\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Round-robin Selection\nagents = [agent1, agent2, agent3]\ncurrent_speaker_idx = 0\n\ndef select_next_speaker():\n    global current_speaker_idx\n    speaker = agents[current_speaker_idx]\n    current_speaker_idx = (current_speaker_idx + 1) % len(agents)\n    return speaker\n\nExample 2: Role-based Handoff\ndef select_speaker(intent):\n    if intent == \"technical_question\":\n        return technical_expert_agent\n    elif intent == \"project_update\":\n        return project_manager_agent\n    else:\n        return default_agent\n\nExample 3: Context-aware After Work Transition\ndef after_work_transition(last_agent, conversation_history):\n    if last_agent == data_gatherer_agent:\n        return summarizer_agent  # Summarizer provides a summary after data gathering\n    return None\n\nExample 4: Custom Orchestration with Dynamic Selection\ndef select_next_speaker(conversation_state):\n    if conversation_state[\"requires_approval\"]:\n        return supervisor_agent\n    elif conversation_state[\"task\"] == \"coding\":\n        return developer_agent\n    elif conversation_state[\"last_agent\"] == developer_agent:\n        return reviewer_agent  # After work transition\n    else:\n        return default_agent\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nAlign speaker selection with task roles: Ensure agents are mapped to tasks that match their expertise.\nDesign clear handoff criteria: Avoid ambiguity in when and how handoffs occur.\nPreserve conversation context: Carry relevant state and history during transitions.\nProvide fallback logic: Handle unexpected inputs or scenarios gracefully.\nMonitor and log transitions: For debugging and improving orchestration patterns.\nFacilitate manual override: Allow human intervention when necessary.\nTest with realistic workflows: Simulate multi-turn, multi-agent interactions to validate orchestration logic.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nRigid speaker selection leading to unnatural conversations.\nUnclear handoff points causing confusion or dropped tasks.\nLosing context during after work transitions.\nOvercomplicating selection logic, making the system hard to maintain.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent orchestration patterns\nLLM configuration and model clients\nTask routing strategies\nConversation state management\nHuman-in-the-loop orchestration\nHandoff and after work transitions\n\nFor a deeper dive on orchestration and advanced agent design, see Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns.\n"},"chapters/advanced-agent-orchestration/transitiontarget-and-handoff-conditions.html":{"url":"chapters/advanced-agent-orchestration/transitiontarget-and-handoff-conditions.html","title":"TransitionTarget and Handoff Conditions","keywords":"","body":"TransitionTarget and handoff conditions\nOverview\nIn advanced agent orchestration, TransitionTarget and handoff conditions are mechanisms to control how conversational turns and responsibilities are transferred between agents (or models) in a multi-agent system. These tools enable dynamic conversation flows, where the system can switch speakers, delegate tasks, or escalate issues based on context, user intent, or business logic. Effective use of transition targets and handoff conditions is essential for building robust, context-aware group chats and orchestrated agent workflows.\n\nExplanation\nTransitionTarget\nA TransitionTarget defines the next agent or model to take over the conversation after a certain condition or event is met. It specifies which agent should become the new speaker, as well as any context or state to be carried forward. TransitionTargets are typically used within orchestration patterns to:\n\nRoute a user's message to the most appropriate agent\nImplement escalation policies (e.g., from a bot to a human)\nManage agent roles (e.g., expert, assistant, moderator)\n\nTypes of TransitionTargets\n\nDirect: Explicitly names the next agent.\nConditional: Chooses the next agent based on conversation context or specific triggers.\nRound-robin or Priority-based: Selects the next agent from a list, using ordering rules.\n\nHandoff Conditions\nHandoff conditions are rules or triggers that determine when a handoff (i.e., a transition) should occur. They are used to detect when the current agent should transfer control to another agent. Common handoff conditions include:\n\nIntent Detection: E.g., if the user's message contains \"talk to human\", handoff to a human agent.\nCompletion of Task: E.g., after booking is confirmed, handoff to a feedback agent.\nError or Exception: E.g., if the current agent is unable to answer, escalate.\nAfter Work (Follow-up): E.g., after a main agent finishes, a support agent follows up.\n\nWorkflow\n\nMonitor: The orchestrator monitors conversation state and agent responses.\nEvaluate: Checks if any handoff conditions are met.\nTransition: If a condition is met, the orchestrator uses the TransitionTarget to select the next agent.\nCarry Context: Optionally, passes conversation state to the next agent.\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Direct Transition on Intent\nSuppose you have two agents: FAQBot and HumanSupport.\n# Orchestration pseudocode\nif user_message.intent == \"human_support\":\n    TransitionTarget = \"HumanSupport\"\nelse:\n    TransitionTarget = \"FAQBot\"\n\nExample 2: Conditional Handoff with After Work Transition\nAfter OrderAgent confirms an order, handoff to FeedbackAgent for collecting user feedback.\nif context[\"order_confirmed\"]:\n    TransitionTarget = \"FeedbackAgent\"\n\nExample 3: Custom Speaker Selection\nUsing a round-robin pattern among a list of expert agents:\nexpert_agents = [\"ExpertA\", \"ExpertB\", \"ExpertC\"]\ncurrent_index = (last_index + 1) % len(expert_agents)\nTransitionTarget = expert_agents[current_index]\n\nExample 4: Orchestration Configuration (YAML)\nagents:\n  - name: FAQBot\n  - name: HumanSupport\n\norchestration:\n  transitions:\n    - condition: user_intent == \"human_support\"\n      target: HumanSupport\n    - condition: true  # default\n      target: FAQBot\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nDefine clear handoff conditions: Ambiguous rules can result in unexpected transitions.\nPreserve context: Ensure relevant information is passed to the next agent.\nAvoid transition loops: Prevent endless handoffs by tracking recent transitions.\nGraceful fallback: Always have a default agent or error handler.\nTest orchestration logic: Validate with varied scenarios and edge cases.\nMonitor for handoff fatigue: Too many transitions can confuse users.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent Orchestration Patterns  \nSpeaker Selection Strategies  \nMulti-Agent Group Chat Design  \nContext Management in Conversations  \nEscalation Policies  \nLLM Configuration and Model Clients  \n\nFor further reading, see the documentation on Orchestration Patterns and After Work Transitions.\n"},"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/":{"url":"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/","title":"Context Variables and Conditional Logic","keywords":"","body":"Context Variables and Conditional Logic\nUsing context for dynamic agent state and conditional transitions\nPrerequisites\n\nAdvanced Agent Orchestration\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nStore and update context variables in multi-agent workflows\nDefine and use conditional logic for agent transitions\nLeverage context expressions for complex flow control\n\nSections\n\nContextVariables\nContextCondition and AvailableCondition\nOnCondition and OnContextCondition\nContextExpression\n\n"},"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/contextvariables.html":{"url":"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/contextvariables.html","title":"Context Variables","keywords":"","body":"ContextVariables\nOverview\nContext Variables are dynamic data elements used to store and share information throughout a multi-agent workflow.

If the condition evaluates to True, the associated transition, action, or agent becomes eligible for execution.\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Agent Transition with ContextCondition\nagents:\n  - name: VerificationAgent\n    on_success:\n      target: ProcessAgent\n      condition: context['user_verified'] == True\n    on_failure:\n      target: RetryAgent\n      condition: context['attempts'] \nExplanation:  \n\nThe transition to ProcessAgent only occurs if the context variable user_verified is True.\nIf not, and if attempts is less than 3, the workflow transitions to RetryAgent.\n\n\nExample 2: Tool Availability with AvailableCondition\ntools:\n  - name: Summarizer\n    available_condition: context.get('input_ready', False)\n\nExplanation:  \n\nThe Summarizer tool is only available if the context variable input_ready is True.\n\n\nExample 3: Dynamic Branching\nif context['score'] > 80:\n    next_agent = 'HighPerformerAgent'\nelif context['score'] > 50:\n    next_agent = 'AveragePerformerAgent'\nelse:\n    next_agent = 'NeedsImprovementAgent'\n\nExplanation:  \n\nThe workflow dynamically routes to a different agent depending on the score context variable.\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nInitialize Context Variables: Ensure all required context variables are initialized before evaluation to avoid runtime errors.\nKeep Conditions Simple: Write clear, concise conditions to maintain readability and ease debugging.\nCentralize Context Updates: Update context variables in predictable locations (e.g., agent completion hooks) to prevent race conditions.\nUse Default Values: When accessing context variables, use .get() with defaults to handle missing keys gracefully.\nTest Complex Logic: For intricate conditions, unit test expressions independently to ensure correct evaluation.\nDocument Variable Usage: Clearly document which agents update or depend on which context variables.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nUsing undefined context variables, leading to errors\nOverly complex expressions, making the workflow hard to maintain\nAccidental overwriting of context keys by multiple agents\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nContext Variables  \nAgent Transitions  \nConditional Branching  \nMulti-Agent Workflow Patterns  \nError Handling in Agent Orchestration  \nAdvanced Control Flow Expressions\n\nFor further reading, consult your orchestration platform's documentation on conditional logic and context management.\n"},"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/oncondition-and-oncontextcondition.html":{"url":"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/oncondition-and-oncontextcondition.html","title":"OnCondition and OnContextCondition","keywords":"","body":"OnCondition and OnContextCondition\nOverview\nIn advanced agent orchestration, OnCondition and OnContextCondition are mechanisms that enable dynamic, context-aware transitions between agents or workflow steps. They allow you to encode conditional logic that evaluates context variables and determines agent behavior or routing within a multi-agent system. By leveraging these constructs, orchestration can adapt to changing context, user input, or external signals, enabling more flexible and intelligent workflows.\n\nExplanation\nOnCondition and OnContextCondition are used to control the flow of execution in multi-agent workflows based on evaluated conditions:\n\nOnCondition: Triggers a transition or action when a specified boolean expression or condition is met. The condition may reference current context variables, agent states, or external inputs.\nOnContextCondition: Similar to OnCondition, but specifically focuses on expressions that involve context variables, such as user state, workflow progress, or shared memory between agents.\n\nContext variables are key-value pairs stored in a workflowâ€™s context object. They allow agents to share information, track progress, or store temporary results. By updating and evaluating these variables, agents can influence each otherâ€™s behavior and orchestrate complex, adaptive flows.\nHow it Works\n\nStoring Context Variables: Agents or orchestrators set and update context variables during execution.\nDefining Conditions: Conditions are expressed using a supported expression language (e.g., Python, Jinja, JSONata, or custom DSL).\nEvaluating Conditions: The orchestrator evaluates the condition at runtime; if it returns true, the specified transition or action is executed.\nFlow Control: This enables branching, looping, or early exits from workflows, depending on context.\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Conditional Agent Routing\n# Pseudocode for a workflow definition\nsteps:\n  - id: gather_user_info\n    agent: UserInfoAgent\n    on_complete:\n      - action: set_context\n        key: user_age\n        value: \"{{ output.age }}\"\n      - action: go_to\n        step: age_check\n\n  - id: age_check\n    on_context_condition:\n      condition: \"{{ context.user_age >= 18 }}\"\n      next_step: adult_flow\n    else:\n      next_step: minor_flow\n\n  - id: adult_flow\n    agent: AdultServicesAgent\n    ...\n\n  - id: minor_flow\n    agent: MinorServicesAgent\n    ...\n\nExplanation:  \n\nAfter gathering user info, the workflow stores the user's age in a context variable.\non_context_condition checks the age and routes the flow to either adult_flow or minor_flow accordingly.\n\n\nExample 2: Looping Until a Condition is Met\n# Pseudocode for an agent loop using OnCondition\n\nwhile not context[\"done\"]:\n    agent_output = SomeAgent.act(context)\n    context[\"done\"] = agent_output[\"is_complete\"]\n    if context[\"done\"]:\n        break\n\nExplanation:  \n\nThe agent continues to run until the \"done\" context variable is set to True by agent output.\n\n\nExample 3: Using OnCondition for Error Handling\n- id: process_payment\n  agent: PaymentAgent\n  on_condition:\n    condition: \"{{ output.success == false }}\"\n    next_step: handle_payment_error\n  else:\n    next_step: confirm_order\n\nExplanation:  \n\nIf payment fails (output.success == false), the workflow transitions to an error handler; otherwise, it confirms the order.\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nKeep Conditions Simple: Complex logic can become hard to maintain; try to encapsulate logic in well-named context variables.\nType Safety: Ensure context variables are properly typed and initialized to avoid runtime errors.\nDocument Context Usage: Clearly document which agents set, read, or modify specific context variables.\nAvoid Circular Dependencies: Be careful when agents depend on variables set by others in the same step or cycle.\nTest Conditions: Write tests for branching logic to ensure all paths are covered and conditions behave as expected.\nGraceful Failure: Always provide fallback paths (e.g., else branches) for conditions that may not be met.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nContext Variables\nAgent Transition Management\nExpression Languages for Orchestration\nError Handling in Workflows\nAdvanced Agent Orchestration (Prerequisite)\nLooping and Iterative Flows\n\nFor further reading, consult the official orchestration documentation and see examples of multi-agent workflows.\n"},"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/contextexpression.html":{"url":"chapters/context-variables-and-conditional-logic/contextexpression.html","title":"Context Expression","keywords":"","body":"ContextExpression\nOverview\nA ContextExpression is a feature in advanced agent orchestration that allows workflows to dynamically reference, evaluate, and manipulate context variables.

However, these frameworks often define their own tool and function interfaces, which can make interoperability and code reuse challenging. Tool conversion enables you to adapt tools and functions from one ecosystem (e.g., LangChain) to another (e.g., CrewAI or AG2), allowing you to build composite agents and pipelines that leverage the strengths of multiple libraries.\nThis chapter explains how to convert external tools to a standard format (such as AG2 Tool), register and use interoperability layers, and integrate tools and functions across frameworks using dependency injection.\n\nExplanation\nWhat is Tool Conversion?\nTool conversion is the process of adapting a function or tool (for example, a LangChain Tool or CrewAI Tool) to a standard interface so it can be used interchangeably in other agent frameworks. This often involves:\n\nWrapping: Encapsulating a tool in an adapter class.\nDependency Injection: Passing dependencies (like API clients) to tools at runtime.\nFormat Standardization: Ensuring input/output signatures match expectations.\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nReuse: Leverage existing tools across frameworks, avoiding duplication.\nComposability: Build complex agents that orchestrate capabilities from multiple ecosystems.\nMaintainability: Standard interfaces make code easier to manage and extend.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nIdentify the External Tool: Locate a tool or function you want to reuse (e.g., a LangChain tool).\nWrap or Convert: Use an interoperability class or adapter to conform the tool to the target interface (e.g., AG2 Tool).\nRegister: Register the converted tool within your agent or tool registry.\nInject Dependencies: Provide any required resources (like database connections) using dependency injection.\n\nAG2 Tool Format\nA typical AG2 Tool interface might look like this (in Python):\nclass AG2Tool:\n    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str, func: Callable):\n        self.name = name\n        self.description = description\n        self.func = func\n\n    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)\n\nInteroperability Classes\nThese are adapter classes designed to bridge tool interfaces. For example, you might have:\n\nLangChainToolAdapter\nCrewAIToolAdapter\n\n\nExamples\n1.

This ensures consistent validation and documentation.\nHandle errors gracefully in your wrapper classes, raising descriptive exceptions for invalid inputs or failed executions.\nUse dependency injection for shared resources (like HTTP clients or database connections) rather than hardcoding them.\nDocument tool metadata (name, description, usage) to improve discoverability and auto-generated docs.\nTest your wrappers with a variety of inputs and edge cases to ensure robust validation.\nKeep interoperability layers thinâ€”avoid complex business logic in the wrapper itself.\n\nCommon Pitfalls\n\nForgetting to validate outputs: Always ensure returned data matches the output schema.\nLeaking tool-specific exceptions: Catch and re-raise as standard errors for the agent framework.\nOmitting default values in schemas, leading to unnecessary validation failures.\nTight coupling: Avoid hardwiring tool-specific logic into the agent; keep wrappers generic.\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nTools and Dependency Injection\nPydantic Documentation\nAG2 Tool Format\nFunction and Tool Orchestration\nType-Safe AI Agents\nError Handling with Pydantic\nOpenAPI & Pydantic\n\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently convert and integrate external tools into interoperable, robust AI agent workflows using Pydantic and AG2 or similar frameworks.\n"},"chapters/retrieval-augmented-generation-and-vector-databases/":{"url":"chapters/retrieval-augmented-generation-and-vector-databases/","title":"Retrieval Augmented Generation and Vector Databases","keywords":"","body":"Retrieval Augmented Generation and Vector Databases\nIncorporating retrieval and search capabilities into agent workflows\nPrerequisites\n\nTool and Function Interoperability\nContext Variables and Conditional Logic\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBuild retrieval-augmented agents for document and knowledge search\nIntegrate and query different vector database backends\nApply chunking and tokenization strategies for efficient retrieval\n\nSections\n\nRetrieveUserProxyAgent\nVectorDB protocol\nChromaDB PGVector Qdrant MongoDB integrations\nQuerying and chunking strategies\n\n"},"chapters/retrieval-augmented-generation-and-vector-databases/retrieveuserproxyagent.html":{"url":"chapters/retrieval-augmented-generation-and-vector-databases/retrieveuserproxyagent.html","title":"RetrieveUserProxyAgent","keywords":"","body":"RetrieveUserProxyAgent\nOverview\nThe RetrieveUserProxyAgent is a specialized agent pattern used in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, enabling intelligent search and retrieval of relevant information from large document collections or knowledge bases. By interfacing with vector databases, the agent can efficiently fetch contextually similar documents or chunks, which are then used to augment generative models (like LLMs) for more accurate, grounded responses. RetrieveUserProxyAgent acts as an orchestrator that manages user queries, interacts with retrieval tools (e.g., vector search APIs), and applies logic for context-informed generation.\n\nExplanation\nThe RetrieveUserProxyAgent sits at the core of a RAG pipeline, bridging user input with backend retrieval and generation functionality. Its main responsibilities include:\n\nProcessing User Queries: Accepts natural language queries and applies necessary pre-processing, such as chunking or tokenization.\nInterfacing with Vector Databases: Converts queries into vector embeddings and searches against vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS, ChromaDB) for semantically similar documents or passages.\nContextual Retrieval: Uses conditional logic and context variables to refine retrieval results, ensuring relevance to the user's intent.\nAugmenting Generation: Supplies retrieved content as context to a generative model (e.g., GPT-4), enabling grounded and contextualized responses.\nTool and Function Interoperability: Orchestrates and integrates multiple toolsâ€”embedding models, vector stores, and LLMsâ€”often by invoking specific functions or APIs.\n\nExample Flow\n\nUser Query: \"What were the main findings of the 2023 climate report?\"\nEmbedding & Vector Search: Query embedded and matched against document chunks in the vector DB.\nRetrieval: Top-k relevant passages retrieved.\nContext Assembly: Chosen passages assembled as additional context.\nGeneration: LLM generates a response using both user query and retrieved context.\n\nChunking and Tokenization\nEfficient retrieval often requires documents to be split (chunked) into overlapping or non-overlapping segments, ensuring that each chunk fits within model or database token limitations while preserving context. Tokenization strategies are chosen to balance retrieval granularity and performance.\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Simple RetrieveUserProxyAgent Workflow (Python Pseudocode)\nfrom my_agent_framework import RetrieveUserProxyAgent\nfrom my_vector_db import VectorStore\nfrom my_embedding_model import EmbeddingModel\nfrom my_llm import LLM\n\n# Initialize components\nembedding_model = EmbeddingModel()\nvector_store = VectorStore(index_name=\"knowledge_base\")\nllm = LLM(model_name=\"gpt-4\")\n\n# Define the agent\nagent = RetrieveUserProxyAgent(\n    embedding_model=embedding_model,\n    vector_store=vector_store,\n    llm=llm,\n    chunk_size=512,  # tokens per chunk\n    overlap=64,      # token overlap\n)\n\n# User query\nquery = \"Summarize the key findings from the 2023 climate report.\"\n\n# Agent processes the query\nresponse = agent.generate(query)\n\nprint(response)\n\nExample 2: Custom Chunking and Conditional Logic\ndef custom_chunk(document, max_tokens=512, overlap=64):\n    # Your custom chunking logic\n    # Returns a list of text chunks\n    pass\n\nagent = RetrieveUserProxyAgent(\n    ...,\n    chunker=custom_chunk,\n    retrieval_filter=lambda chunk, query: \"climate\" in chunk.lower() or \"2023\" in chunk,\n)\n\nExample 3: Tool Interoperability\n# Using different vector backends\nvector_store = PineconeVectorStore(api_key=\"...\")\nagent = RetrieveUserProxyAgent(vector_store=vector_store, ...)\n\n# Using a different embedding model\nembedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddingModel(api_key=\"...\")\nagent.embedding_model = embedding_model\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nChunk Size Tuning: Optimize chunk size and overlap to balance recall and precision; too small loses context, too large may miss details.\nTokenization Consistency: Ensure the same tokenization method is used during both document indexing and query time.\nBackend Flexibility: Design agents to easily switch between vector backends (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB) as requirements evolve.\nContext Window Awareness: Be mindful of model input size limits when assembling retrieved context for the generative model.\nConditional Retrieval: Use context variables and custom filters to fine-tune which chunks are considered relevant.\nEvaluate Retrieval Quality: Regularly benchmark retrieval results and tune scoring thresholds.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nIndexing and querying with different embedding models or tokenization schemes.\nIgnoring context window limits, leading to truncated or incomplete prompts.\nOver-reliance on retrieval without validating factuality in generation.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nVector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS, ChromaDB)\nChunking and Tokenization Strategies\nTool/Function Interoperability\nContext Variables and Conditional Logic\nPrompt Engineering for RAG\nOpenAI Embeddings API\n\nFor further reading, see:\n\nLangChain: Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nHaystack: Building RAG Pipelines\n\n\n"},"chapters/retrieval-augmented-generation-and-vector-databases/vectordb-protocol.html":{"url":"chapters/retrieval-augmented-generation-and-vector-databases/vectordb-protocol.html","title":"VectorDB Protocol","keywords":"","body":"VectorDB protocol\nOverview\nThe VectorDB protocol refers to a standardized interface and set of operations for interacting with vector databases (VectorDBs) in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. VectorDBs enable efficient storage, search, and retrieval of high-dimensional embeddingsâ€”dense vector representations of documents, images, or other data. The protocol abstracts over different backends (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, FAISS), allowing agents and applications to perform similarity search, insert, update, and delete operations in a uniform way.\nThe VectorDB protocol is essential for building interoperable RAG agents that can leverage context variables, conditional logic, and tool integration for advanced knowledge retrieval.\n\nExplanation\nWhy VectorDBs?\nTraditional databases are not optimized for searching by similarity in high-dimensional spaces. VectorDBs solve this by:\n\nStoring embeddings (vectors) generated from documents, images, etc.\nEnabling fast nearest-neighbor search (often via Approximate Nearest Neighbor, ANN, algorithms).\nSupporting operations like insert, update, delete, and filter by metadata.\n\nThe Protocol: Key Operations\nThe VectorDB protocol typically defines methods such as:\n\nUpsert/Insert: Add new vectors with optional metadata.\nQuery/Search: Retrieve top-k vectors most similar to a query vector.\nDelete: Remove vectors by ID or filter.\nUpdate: Modify vector data or metadata.\nMetadata Filtering: Restrict queries to vectors matching metadata criteria.\n\nBy adhering to this protocol, agents and tools can switch between vector database backends without changing core logic.\nTool and Function Interoperability\nThe protocol enables tool interoperability by defining a common API. For example, a RAG agent can use a query method regardless of whether the underlying database is Pinecone or FAISS.\nContext variables (e.g., user ID, session context) and conditional logic (e.g., query routing, dynamic filters) can be leveraged to fine-tune retrieval, personalize search, or implement business rules.\n\nExamples\n1.

Two critical components for effective RAG systems are querying (how user questions are transformed and matched against the database) and chunking (how documents are split into retrievable units). Optimal strategies for querying and chunking significantly impact search accuracy, efficiency, and the quality of generated responses.\n\nExplanation\nChunking Strategies\nChunking refers to dividing large documents into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks) before embedding and storing them in a vector database. The goal is to balance sufficient context per chunk with the need to avoid excessive length (which can hurt retrieval and generation).\nCommon chunking approaches:\n\nFixed-size chunking: Split text into segments of fixed word, sentence, or token count (e.g., 512 tokens per chunk).\nSemantic chunking: Split based on semantic boundaries such as paragraphs, headings, or logical sections.\nSliding window: Overlap chunks by a certain amount to preserve context between them.\n\nWhy is chunking important?\n\nToo large: retrieval may miss relevant information or exceed model context limits.\nToo small: loses context, resulting in fragmented or less meaningful retrievals.\n\nQuerying Strategies\nQuerying involves transforming the user's question into a vector (embedding) and searching for the most similar chunks in the database. Strategies impact precision, recall, and speed.\nKey querying considerations:\n\nEmbedding model selection: Use models with strong semantic representation (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, Cohere, or open-source alternatives).\nQuery expansion: Augment queries with synonyms, keywords, or context variables to improve recall.\nConditional logic: Dynamically adjust queries based on user context or tool outputs (e.g., user role, prior queries).\nTool and function interoperability: Integrate with external tools or APIs to refine or post-process queries and results.\n\nRanking and Filtering:\n\nMany vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) support additional metadata filtering, allowing for hybrid search (combining vector similarity and structured filters).\n\n\nExamples\n1. Chunking a Document\nfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n\ndef chunk_text(text, max_tokens=200):\n    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n    chunks = []\n    current_chunk = []\n    tokens_so_far = 0\n\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        tokens = sentence.split()\n        if tokens_so_far + len(tokens) > max_tokens:\n            chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))\n            current_chunk = []\n            tokens_so_far = 0\n        current_chunk.append(sentence)\n        tokens_so_far += len(tokens)\n    if current_chunk:\n        chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))\n    return chunks\n\n# Example usage\ndocument = \"...\"  # large document string\nchunks = chunk_text(document, max_tokens=150)\n\n2.

This approach is critical in scenarios where LLM outputs need to be parsed, validated, or consumed programmatically, such as in tool calling, API responses, or function executions. By defining and enforcing a schema, developers can reliably extract information, reduce ambiguity, and enable seamless integration with downstream systems.\n\nExplanation\nLLMs by default generate free-form text, which can be ambiguous or difficult to parse. Structured output formatting addresses this by:\n\nDefining a function or tool with a JSON schema: You specify the expected input and output structure, often using JSON Schema.\nRegistering the function with the LLM client: The LLM is informed about the available functions/tools and their input formats.\nPrompting the LLM for structured outputs: The LLM is instructed to respond in a way that matches the schema, enabling automatic extraction and execution of function calls.\nHandling tool call and function call messages: The system interprets special messages (often in OpenAI or similar APIs) that indicate when a function/tool should be called, and with what arguments.\n\nThis process allows the LLM to act as an orchestrator, calling backend tools or functions as necessary and ensuring that all communication follows a well-defined, machine-readable structure.\n\nExamples\n1. Defining and Registering a Function with JSON Schema\nSuppose you want the LLM to call a function get_weather that takes a city argument:\nimport openai\n\nget_weather_schema = {\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a specified city.\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"city\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"Name of the city to get weather for.\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"city\"]\n    }\n}\n\n# Register the function with your LLM client (example: OpenAI)\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather in Paris?\"}],\n    functions=[get_weather_schema]\n)\n\n2. LLM Responding with a Structured Function Call\nThe LLM's response might include a function call message:\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": null,\n  \"function_call\": {\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"arguments\": \"{ \\\"city\\\": \\\"Paris\\\" }\"\n  }\n}\n\nYour application would then:\n\nParse the function_call object.\nCall your backend get_weather(\"Paris\").\nReturn the result to the user.\n\n3. Configuring Structured Output Formatting in Prompting\nWhen you want the LLM to always respond in a specific JSON format:\nprompt = \"\"\"\nExtract the following information from the text and respond in JSON:\n- name\n- email\n- phone number\n\nText: \"Contact Jane Doe at jane.doe@example.com or call 555-1234.\"\n\"\"\"\n\n# Use function-calling or output parser libraries (e.g., Pydantic, Cerberus) to validate the output.\n\nExpected output:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"email\": \"jane.doe@example.com\",\n  \"phone\": \"555-1234\"\n}\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nDefine clear, concise schemas: Use JSON Schema or similar to describe expected arguments and outputs.\nValidate inputs and outputs: Always validate the structure before processing to prevent errors.\nHandle edge cases: Consider what happens if the LLM returns malformed or incomplete data.\nUse incremental deployment: Start with simple schemas and expand as you gain confidence.\nLog and monitor: Track schema mismatches and failures for debugging and improvement.\nKeep functions atomic: Each function should have a single, clear responsibility.\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n\nOverly complex schemas may confuse the LLM or lead to parsing errors.\nFree-form text in outputs can break downstream parsing.\nFailing to handle missing or extra fields gracefully.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nFunction Calling with LLMs\nTool Use and Orchestration\nDependency Injection with LLM Tooling\nPrompt Engineering for Structured Outputs\nJSON Schema Documentation\n\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nOpenAI Function Calling Guide\nLangChain Output Parsers\nPydantic Documentation\n\n"},"chapters/structured-outputs-and-tool-calling-with-llms/tool-call-and-function-call-message-handling.html":{"url":"chapters/structured-outputs-and-tool-calling-with-llms/tool-call-and-function-call-message-handling.html","title":"Tool Call and Function Call Message Handling","keywords":"","body":"Tool call and function call message handling\nOverview\nTool call and function call message handling refers to the process by which Large Language Models (LLMs) are empowered to interact with external functions, APIs, or \"tools\" during a conversation. By defining and registering functions with a JSON schema, developers can enable LLMs to produce structured outputs that trigger specific actions, such as querying databases, fetching information, or performing calculations. This process involves configuring the LLM to recognize tool calls, formatting responses for downstream consumption, and managing the full message flow between user, model, and tools.\n\nExplanation\n1. Defining and Registering Functions\nTo enable LLMs to call functions, each function (or \"tool\") must be registered with a schema that defines its name, description, and parameters using JSON Schema. This schema informs the model about what functions are available, their arguments, and how to format calls.\nExample schema:\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n  \"description\": \"Retrieve current weather information for a city.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"city\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Name of the city\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"city\"]\n  }\n}\n\n2. Configuring Structured Outputs\nWhen configured for structured outputs, the LLM returns a special output format (often as a JSON object or via a specific message protocol). This output includes details about the function to call and its arguments, rather than plain text.\nExample output:\n{\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"city\": \"Paris\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n3. Message Flow Management\nThe typical message flow for tool/function calling is:\n\nUser sends input:E.g., \"What's the weather in Paris?\"\n\nLLM responds with tool call:  \n\nStructured output indicating which tool to invoke and with what arguments.\n\n\nApplication invokes tool:  \n\nBackend extracts tool call from model output.\nCalls the corresponding registered function with provided arguments.\n\n\nApplication returns results to LLM (optional):  \n\nSends results back to LLM as a function result message for further reasoning or response synthesis.\n\n\nLLM produces final user-facing response:  \n\nE.g., \"The weather in Paris is 22Â°C and sunny.\"\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nPython Example Using OpenAI API\nRegistering a function\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nfunctions = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Retrieve current weather information for a city.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"city\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"Name of the city\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"city\"]\n        }\n    }\n]\n\nSending a tool call enabled request\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather in Paris?\"}],\n    tools=functions,\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"  # or specify a tool if needed\n)\n\ntool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls\n\nHandling the tool call\ndef get_weather(city):\n    # Dummy function for demonstration\n    return f\"The weather in {city} is 22Â°C and sunny.\"\n\nfor call in tool_calls:\n    if call.name == \"get_weather\":\n        result = get_weather(**call.arguments)\n        # Send function result back to the LLM if further reasoning is desired\n        # Or format the final response for the user\n\nMessage Flow Diagram\nUser Input  -->  LLM (Tool Call Output)  -->  App (Tool Invocation)  -->  LLM (Optional Reasoning)  -->  Final Response\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nDefine clear, unambiguous schemas: Use descriptive names and parameter descriptions to help the LLM choose and populate tools correctly.\nValidate input and output: Always validate that the LLM's tool call arguments match your schema before invoking a function.\nHandle errors gracefully: Prepare for missing or malformed arguments, tool failures, or ambiguous LLM responses.\nLimit tool exposure: Only register functions that should be accessible to the model to minimize risk.\nChain tool calls carefully: If using multiple tools or multi-step reasoning, manage message state and context explicitly.\nMonitor usage: Log tool calls and monitor for unexpected or malicious use.\nVersion your schemas: If your function signatures change, version them to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nStructured Outputs with LLMs  \nLLM Configuration and Model Clients\nTools and Dependency Injection\nFunction Calling in OpenAI API\nJSON Schema\nPrompt Engineering for Tool Use\nChaining and Orchestration with LLMs\n\n\n"},"chapters/multimodal-and-vision-capabilities/":{"url":"chapters/multimodal-and-vision-capabilities/","title":"Multimodal and Vision Capabilities","keywords":"","body":"Multimodal and Vision Capabilities\nExtending agents to handle images and multimodal content\nPrerequisites\n\nStructured Outputs and Tool Calling with LLMs\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nIntegrate image generation and captioning in agents\nProcess and format multimodal messages\nLeverage vision capabilities for practical tasks\n\nSections\n\nMultimodalConversableAgent\nVisionCapability\nImage generation and captioning tools\nContent formatting for images\n\n"},"chapters/multimodal-and-vision-capabilities/multimodalconversableagent.html":{"url":"chapters/multimodal-and-vision-capabilities/multimodalconversableagent.html","title":"Multimodal Conversable Agent","keywords":"","body":"MultimodalConversableAgent\nOverview\nA MultimodalConversableAgent is an advanced conversational agent capable of understanding, generating, and reasoning over both textual and visual (image) data.

This involves integrating images with text (such as captions, descriptions, and metadata), handling image inputs and outputs, and ensuring that agents can understand, generate, and utilize images effectively within their workflows.\nExplanation\nWhen working with multimodal agents, images are treated as first-class content types alongside text and other modalities. Effective content formatting allows these agents to:\n\nAccept images as input: Users or other systems can provide images for analysis, captioning, or further processing.\nGenerate images as output: Agents can create images using generative models and return them in a structured format.\nAssociate metadata: Images are often accompanied by captions, annotations, or detailed descriptions to provide context and enhance understanding.\nFormat multimodal messages: Agents must deliver responses that combine text and images in a coherent, structured wayâ€”often using standardized formats such as JSON objects, Markdown, or HTML.\n\nExample Scenarios\n\nImage Captioning: An agent receives an image and returns a descriptive caption in structured output.\nImage Generation: Given a text prompt, the agent generates an image and returns both the image and an accompanying caption.\nMultimodal Tool Use: Agents invoke tools that process images, such as OCR, object detection, or image editing, and return results in a unified format.\n\nExamples\n1.

By designing capabilities as composable units, developers can create complex, multimodal agents with clear separation of concerns.\n\nExplanation\nThe AgentCapability base class encapsulates logic or skills that can be attached to an agent. Each capability provides specific methods or message handlers, which the agent can invoke during interaction. This pattern allows developers to:\n\nCompose multiple capabilities: An agent can be constructed with any combination of capabilities (e.g., vision, memory, reasoning).\nIsolate functionality: Each capability encapsulates its own state and logic, making the system maintainable and testable.\nEnable teachability: Capabilities can manage knowledge bases with vector memory for storing and retrieving information.\nHandle context and conditional logic: Capabilities can implement context-aware behaviors, transforming messages or responses as needed.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nAbstract Interface: Defines required methods (e.g., handle_message, transform_message).\nRegistration: Capabilities are registered to an agent, which delegates tasks based on message types or context.\nComposability: Multiple capabilities can be combined, allowing agents to support a wide range of features.\n\nExample Structure\nclass AgentCapability:\n    \"\"\"\n    Base class for agent capabilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    def handle_message(self, message, context):\n        \"\"\"\n        Process incoming message and return a response.\n        \"\"\"\n        raise NotImplementedError\n\n    def transform_message(self, message, context):\n        \"\"\"\n        Optionally transform the message based on context or state.\n        \"\"\"\n        return message\n\n    # Additional optional methods for teachability, memory, etc.\n\n\nExamples\n1.

By equipping agents with teachable behaviors and vector-based memory, developers can create dynamic, adaptive systems that personalize responses, retain knowledge over time, and integrate new skills or concepts on-the-fly. Composability further allows these capabilities to be combined with other agent functionalities, such as multimodal processing and context-aware logic, to produce robust and flexible agents.\n\nExplanation\nTeachability\nTeachability refers to an agent's ability to update its knowledge base or behavior in response to user instructions or new information, without requiring developer intervention. This empowers users to \"teach\" the agent new facts, preferences, or tasks during conversations.\nMemory\nMemory enables agents to store, retrieve, and leverage information from past interactions. Vector memory, in particular, utilizes vector embeddings to represent and recall knowledge efficiently, supporting semantic search and contextual retrieval. This allows agents to remember not just exact phrases, but also related concepts and meanings.\nComposability\nAgents can combine teachability and memory with other capabilities (e.g., vision, multimodal analysis, conditional logic) to deliver richer, more context-aware experiences.\nExample Workflow\n\nUser teaches agent a new fact: \"My favorite color is teal.\"\nAgent stores this as a vector embedding in its memory.\nLater, agent is asked: \"What color do I like?\"\nAgent retrieves relevant memory and responds: \"Your favorite color is teal.\"\n\nMessage Transforms\nMessage transforms are mechanisms applied to incoming/outgoing messages, enabling context management, memory updates, or custom processing steps. For example, a transform might tag messages with user IDs, preprocess inputs, or inject retrieved memories into prompts.\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Composing Capabilities in a Teachable Agent\nfrom agent_framework import Agent, VectorMemory, Teachability, Vision, Multimodal, ContextManager\n\n# Compose capabilities\nmemory = VectorMemory(size=2048)\nteachability = Teachability(memory=memory)\nvision = Vision()\nmultimodal = Multimodal()\n\n# Define agent with multiple capabilities\nagent = Agent(\n    capabilities=[teachability, memory, vision, multimodal],\n    context_manager=ContextManager()\n)\n\nExample 2: Teaching and Recalling Knowledge\n# Teach the agent\nuser_message = \"My cat's name is Whiskers.\"\nagent.process(user_message)  # Agent stores fact in vector memory\n\n# Ask the agent a related question\nquery = \"What is my cat's name?\"\nresponse = agent.process(query)\nprint(response)  # \"Your cat's name is Whiskers.\"\n\nExample 3: Message Transform for Context Management\ndef inject_relevant_memories(message, agent):\n    # Retrieve related memories based on current message\n    memories = agent.memory.search(message, top_k=3)\n    # Append memories to message context\n    message.context['retrieved_memories'] = memories\n    return message\n\n# Register transform\nagent.context_manager.add_transform(inject_relevant_memories)\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nIsolate Teachability Logic: Separate teachable behavior from core agent logic for maintainability.\nUse Vector Embeddings for Memory: Enables fuzzy retrieval and semantic matching, not just keyword search.\nLimit Memory Size: Implement memory pruning or summarization to control storage and performance.\nApply Contextual Transforms: Use message transforms to manage context, inject relevant memories, and avoid context bloat.\nHandle Sensitive Data Carefully: Ensure memory does not inadvertently retain private or sensitive information.\nTest Composability: Validate that multiple capabilities work harmoniously and do not introduce unintended side effects.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nForgetting to update or clear memory when needed\nOverloading context with irrelevant information\nFailing to handle conflicting user instructions\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nMultimodal and Vision Capabilities\nContext Variables and Conditional Logic\nPrompt Engineering\nStateful vs. Stateless Agents\nMemory Management Strategies\nKnowledge Graphs and Semantic Search\n\nFor further reading:\n\nOpenAI Cookbook: Vector Databases & Memory\nLangChain: Memory Concepts\nMessage Passing and Middleware in Agent Frameworks\n\n"},"chapters/agent-capabilities-and-composability/toolscapability-composition.html":{"url":"chapters/agent-capabilities-and-composability/toolscapability-composition.html","title":"ToolsCapability Composition","keywords":"","body":"ToolsCapability composition\nOverview\nToolsCapability composition refers to the design and integration of multiple agent capabilitiesâ€”such as tool usage, multimodal perception, memory, and context handlingâ€”into a single, cohesive agent.

Composability enables modular, extensible agent architectures that can adapt to diverse use cases and workflows.\n\nExplanation\nModern AI agents often require more than a single capability to function effectively. For instance, an agent may need to:\n\nInterpret images (vision capability)\nAnswer questions using external APIs or tools (tool capability)\nRemember past interactions (memory/vector memory)\nAdapt responses based on context variables or conditions\n\nToolsCapability composition is the process of combining these capabilities into a unified agent.

This enables orchestration logic such as:\n\nBranching workflows according to agent results\nCoordinating multiple agents based on shared state\nReacting to failures, successes, or specific data\n\nIn group and swarm settings, OnCondition is often used to synchronize progress or trigger collective responses.\nSyntax Example\nOnCondition(predicate, then=transition)\n\n\npredicate: A function or expression evaluated in the current workflow context.\nthen: The transition or action to perform if the predicate is true.\n\nNested Chat Transitions\nChat transitions represent conversational state changes between agents or groups. Nested transitions occur when a transition triggers another chat or agent workflow, allowing for:\n\nMulti-level agent delegation\nSubtask orchestration within group or swarm patterns\nLayered escalation or fallback behaviors\n\nAfterWork\nThe AfterWork construct is commonly used to chain transitions after an agent (or group) completes its assigned work. Combining OnCondition with AfterWork enables highly dynamic, reactive agent orchestration.\nExample Flow\n\nGroup of agents completes initial work.\nAfterWork triggers an OnCondition check.\nIf the condition is met, a nested chat or agent workflow is launched.\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Swarm Review with Conditional Rework\nSuppose a swarm of agents reviews a document. If any agent flags an issue, a nested chat is started to resolve it.\n# Pseudocode for clarity\n\n# Swarm group reviews a document\nswarm = SwarmAgentGroup(\n    agents=[ReviewerAgent1(), ReviewerAgent2(), ReviewerAgent3()],\n    task=ReviewDocumentTask(document)\n)\n\n# After all reviewers complete, check if any issues were flagged\nAfterWork(\n    swarm,\n    OnCondition(\n        predicate=lambda ctx: any(r.issues for r in ctx.results),\n        then=NestedChat(\n            agents=[LeadReviewer()],\n            task=ResolveIssuesTask(ctx.collect_issues())\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nExplanation:  \n\nThe swarm reviews the document in parallel.\nAfter all reviews, OnCondition checks if there are issues.\nIf so, a nested chat with a lead reviewer is triggered.\n\n\nExample 2: Group Escalation on Failure\nIf a set of agents fails to reach consensus, escalate to a supervisor agent.\ngroup = AgentGroup(\n    agents=[AgentA(), AgentB()],\n    task=DecisionTask()\n)\n\nAfterWork(\n    group,\n    OnCondition(\n        predicate=lambda ctx: not ctx.result.consensus,\n        then=NestedChat(\n            agents=[SupervisorAgent()],\n            task=ResolveDisagreementTask(ctx.result.details)\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nExplanation:  \n\nInitial agents attempt to reach consensus.\nIf failed, escalation is automatically triggered via a nested chat.\n\n\nExample 3: Multi-level Delegation\nA primary agent delegates a task to a group. If the group cannot handle it, the task is escalated to a swarm.\nprimary_agent = PrimaryAgent()\n\nAfterWork(\n    primary_agent,\n    OnCondition(\n        predicate=lambda ctx: ctx.result.status == 'needs_help',\n        then=NestedChat(\n            agents=[HelperGroup()],\n            task=AssistTask(ctx.result.details),\n            after=OnCondition(\n                predicate=lambda ctx: ctx.result.status == 'unresolved',\n                then=NestedChat(\n                    agents=[Swarm()],\n                    task=EscalatedAssistTask(ctx.result.details)\n                )\n            )\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nExplanation:  \n\nNested transitions allow fallback to increasingly capable groups.\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nKeep predicates simple and performant:Complex conditions can slow orchestration or introduce hard-to-debug logic.\n\nAvoid deep nesting:Excessive nested transitions can make workflows hard to follow and maintain.Use clear hierarchy and documentation.\n\nLeverage shared context:Ensure all nested transitions receive the necessary context or results from parent workflows.\n\nPlan for failure and timeouts:Always handle error conditions and consider what happens if nested chats do not resolve as expected.\n\nTest at each orchestration level:Unit test each OnCondition and AfterWork transition independently before integrating.\n\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent Group Patterns\nSwarm Coordination Strategies\nAgent Capabilities and Composability\nAdvanced Agent Orchestration\nError Handling and Recovery in Agent Workflows\nComposable Agent Workflows\n\n\nFor further reading, see the documentation on Nested Transitions and AfterWork Patterns.\n"},"chapters/group-and-swarm-agent-patterns/pattern-classes-for-orchestration.html":{"url":"chapters/group-and-swarm-agent-patterns/pattern-classes-for-orchestration.html","title":"Pattern Classes for Orchestration","keywords":"","body":"Pattern classes for orchestration\nOverview\nPattern classes for orchestration are modular constructs that enable advanced coordination of multiple agents in group or swarm settings.

By leveraging these patternsâ€”such as AfterWork, OnCondition, and othersâ€”developers can efficiently manage agent collaboration, ensure robust communication, and design workflows that dynamically adapt to the environment or task outcomes.\n\nExplanation\n1. Group and Swarm Patterns\n\nGroup patterns focus on orchestrating a fixed or structured collection of agents, often with explicit roles or responsibilities.\nSwarm patterns emphasize decentralized coordination, where agents operate with collective, emergent behaviors and minimal central control.\n\nPattern classes encapsulate complex orchestration logic, making it easier to compose, extend, and maintain group or swarm workflows.\n2. Key Pattern Classes\nAfterWork\nAfterWork handles workflow transitions by specifying what should occur after a set of agents (or a group) completes their current work. It's instrumental in defining nested chat transitions or follow-up tasks, enabling seamless chaining and coordination of agent activities.\nUsage:\n\nTriggering a follow-up discussion or review after task completion\nRouting outputs to subsequent workflows or agent groups\n\nOnCondition\nOnCondition enables conditional orchestration based on the state of agents, their outputs, or environmental cues. It supports designing complex, adaptive workflows that respond to dynamic conditions.\nUsage:\n\nBranching workflows depending on results or agent feedback\nTriggering escalation or fallback procedures\n\n3. Orchestration Patterns in Action\nBy combining these pattern classes, developers can build nested, adaptive workflows, such as:\n\nA swarm of agents collaboratively analyzing data, with a group leader initiating a summary phase (AfterWork) once consensus is reached.\nConditional escalation to an expert group (OnCondition) if swarm confidence is low.\n\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Nested Chat Transitions with AfterWork\nfrom orchestration.patterns import AfterWork, Group, Agent\n\n# Define agents\nreviewers = Group([Agent(\"Reviewer1\"), Agent(\"Reviewer2\")])\nmoderator = Agent(\"Moderator\")\n\n# Workflow: Reviewers discuss, then moderator summarizes\nworkflow = AfterWork(\n    group=reviewers,\n    after=lambda outputs: moderator.chat(inputs=outputs)\n)\n\nresult = workflow.run(inputs=\"Review this document.\")\n\nIn this example, the AfterWork pattern transitions from a group discussion to a moderator summary phase.\n\nExample 2: Conditional Escalation with OnCondition\nfrom orchestration.patterns import OnCondition, Swarm, Agent\n\n# Swarm of agents analyzing a dataset\nanalysts = Swarm([Agent(\"AnalystA\"), Agent(\"AnalystB\"), Agent(\"AnalystC\")])\nexpert = Agent(\"Expert\")\n\n# Condition: Escalate if consensus score \nHere, OnCondition directs the workflow based on swarm consensus.\n\nExample 3: Combining Patterns for Complex Orchestration\n# Swarm collaborates, then conditional follow-up with expert group\nswarm = Swarm([...])\nexperts = Group([...])\n\ndef needs_expert_review(context):\n    return context['flagged']\n\nmain_workflow = AfterWork(\n    group=swarm,\n    after=lambda outputs: OnCondition(\n        condition=needs_expert_review,\n        if_true=lambda context: experts.chat(inputs=context['outputs']),\n        if_false=lambda context: context['outputs']\n    ).run(context={'flagged': outputs.flagged, 'outputs': outputs.data})\n)\n\nfinal_result = main_workflow.run(inputs=\"Process this request.\")\n\nThis pattern chains AfterWork and OnCondition for robust multi-stage workflows.\n\nBest Practices\n\nEncapsulate orchestration logic: Use pattern classes to isolate workflow logic from agent implementation.\nPromote composability: Chain pattern classes to build complex workflows from simple primitives.\nDesign for scalability: Use swarm patterns for large, decentralized agent sets; group patterns for structured collaboration.\nLeverage conditions wisely: Ensure OnCondition triggers are explicit and based on well-defined agent outputs or states.\nHandle nested transitions: Use AfterWork to manage multi-stage workflows and avoid tangled control flows.\nMonitor for deadlocks: Avoid circular transitions or unhandled conditions that can stall workflows.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAdvanced Agent Orchestration\nAgent Capabilities and Composability\nSwarm Intelligence\nAgent Roles and Group Dynamics\nWorkflow Composition Patterns\nConditional Logic in Multi-Agent Systems\nEvent-Driven Orchestration\n\n\nFor further reading, see the documentation on Group and Swarm Agent Patterns and Composable Agent Architectures.\n"},"chapters/practical-pitfalls-and-best-practices/":{"url":"chapters/practical-pitfalls-and-best-practices/","title":"Practical Pitfalls and Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"Practical Pitfalls and Best Practices\nAvoiding common mistakes and applying best practices in complex agent systems\nPrerequisites\n\nAll previous chapters\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nIdentify and avoid common pitfalls in multi-agent workflows\nApply security best practices for tool and code execution\nImplement robust logging and monitoring for agents\n\nSections\n\nError handling in agent orchestration\nSecurity considerations for code execution\nTesting and logging strategies\n\n"},"chapters/practical-pitfalls-and-best-practices/error-handling-in-agent-orchestration.html":{"url":"chapters/practical-pitfalls-and-best-practices/error-handling-in-agent-orchestration.html","title":"Error Handling in Agent Orchestration","keywords":"","body":"Error handling in agent orchestration\nOverview\nError handling in agent orchestration refers to the strategies and mechanisms used to detect, manage, and recover from failures or unexpected behaviors in workflows involving multiple collaborating agents.

Unrestricted code execution can expose your system to attacks such as code injection, privilege escalation, data leakage, and denial of service. This chapter addresses common security pitfalls and presents best practices for securely handling code execution in agent workflows.\n\nExplanation\nWhy is Code Execution Risky?\nMulti-agent systems often automate complex workflows, sometimes allowing dynamic or user-supplied code execution. Without proper safeguards, this can lead to:\n\nUnauthorized Access: Malicious code could access sensitive files or data.\nSystem Compromise: Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to gain control over the host system.\nResource Exhaustion: Poorly written or malicious scripts can consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk resources.\nData Leakage: Sensitive information may be inadvertently exposed to unauthorized parties.\n\nKey Attack Vectors\n\nCode Injection: Unsanitized input leads to execution of unintended commands.\nInsecure Dependencies: Third-party libraries or tools may introduce vulnerabilities.\nImproper Permissions: Running agents with excessive privileges increases risk.\nLack of Monitoring: Without logging, attacks or misuse can go undetected.\n\nExample Scenario\nSuppose an agent accepts Python code snippets to automate data analysis.

Effective testing ensures that agents behave as expected under various scenarios, while comprehensive logging provides visibility into their actions, enabling easier debugging, monitoring, and auditing. Together, these strategies help maintain security, reliability, and scalability in complex agent workflows.\n\nExplanation\n1. Testing in Multi-Agent Workflows\nTesting multi-agent systems involves more than just verifying individual components. It requires validating the interactions, communication, and coordination among agents, as well as the integration with external tools and APIs. Key aspects include:\n\nUnit Testing: Isolate and test individual agent functions.\nIntegration Testing: Test interactions among agents and external services.\nEnd-to-End Testing: Simulate real-world workflows and scenarios.\nSecurity Testing: Ensure agents handle sensitive data and tool execution securely.\n\nAutomated tests with clear assertions and simulated environments (mocks/stubs) are essential. Given the dynamic nature of multi-agent workflows, tests should cover edge cases such as message loss, out-of-order execution, and failed tool invocations.\n2. Logging and Monitoring\nRobust logging provides detailed records of agent activities, decisions, and errors. This is vital for:\n\nDebugging: Trace issues in complex agent interactions.\nAuditing: Maintain security and compliance.\nMonitoring: Detect anomalies or failures in production.\n\nLogging strategies should:\n\nCapture context: agent ID, timestamps, actions, tool invocations, and responses.\nDifferentiate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG).\nAvoid logging sensitive data.\n\nCentralized log aggregation (using tools like ELK stack, Datadog, or CloudWatch) and real-time monitoring dashboards help maintain operational visibility.\n\nExamples\nExample 1: Unit Testing an Agentâ€™s Decision Logic\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestAgentDecision(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_should_execute_tool(self):\n        agent = MyAgent()\n        input_data = {\"intent\": \"search\", \"query\": \"weather\"}\n        decision = agent.should_execute_tool(input_data)\n        self.assertTrue(decision)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n\nExample 2: Mocking Tool Execution in Integration Tests\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\ndef test_agent_tool_interaction():\n    agent = MyAgent()\n    with patch('tools.weather_api.get_weather') as mock_get_weather:\n        mock_get_weather.return_value = {\"temp\": 22, \"unit\": \"C\"}\n        result = agent.process_request(\"What's the weather?\")\n        assert \"22Â°C\" in result\n\nExample 3: Structured Logging for Agent Actions\nimport logging\nimport json\n\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.INFO,\n    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s'\n)\n\ndef log_agent_action(agent_id, action, details):\n    logging.info(json.dumps({\n        \"agent_id\": agent_id,\n        \"action\": action,\n        \"details\": details\n    }))\n\n# Usage\nlog_agent_action(\n    agent_id=\"agent_123\",\n    action=\"tool_invocation\",\n    details={\"tool\": \"search\", \"query\": \"python logging\"}\n)\n\nExample 4: Masking Sensitive Data in Logs\ndef mask_sensitive(data):\n    if 'api_key' in data:\n        data['api_key'] = '***REDACTED***'\n    return data\n\ndef log_tool_execution(agent_id, tool, params):\n    safe_params = mask_sensitive(params.copy())\n    logging.info(f\"Agent {agent_id} invoked {tool} with params {safe_params}\")\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nWrite layered tests: Cover unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios.\nUse mocks and stubs: Simulate external dependencies and tool outputs.\nAutomate test runs: Integrate tests with CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation.\nImplement structured logging: Use consistent, machine-readable log formats (e.g., JSON).\nSeparate log levels: Use appropriate logging levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG).\nRedact sensitive information: Never log secrets, credentials, or personal data.\nCentralize logs: Aggregate logs from all agents for unified monitoring and alerting.\nMonitor for anomalies: Set up alerts for unusual agent behaviors or failures.\nReview logs regularly: Use logs for periodic audits and debugging.\nTest for security: Verify that agents handle tool execution and data securely.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n\nInsufficient test coverage for edge cases and error conditions.\nLogging sensitive data inadvertently.\nIgnoring failures in agent-to-agent or agent-to-tool communication.\nLack of centralized log management.\nOverlooking security testing for tool and code execution.\n\n\nRelated Concepts\n\nAgent communication patterns\nSecurity best practices for agents\nMonitoring and observability\nTesting microservices\nELK Stack for logging\nPython unittest Documentation\nLogging in Python\n\n"}}}
