  overview: |
    Installation is the first step to getting started with the project. This section guides you through installing the core package, configuring dependencies, and verifying your setup, ensuring you are ready to build, configure, and run agent-based applications using the framework's abstractions like ConversableAgent, Tool, GroupChat, and LLMConfig.

  explanation: |
    The project supports flexible agentic communication, tool integration, group orchestration, and LLM management. To unlock these capabilities, you need to install the core package and configure any required dependencies (e.g., LLM provider access, API keys, and optional toolkits). Installation is usually done via pip, but certain features (like group orchestration or interoperability) may require extra dependencies.

    After installation, you should verify the installation by importing key modules and running a minimal agent example. For LLM-backed agents, configure your API keys and environment variables as recommended (see LLMConfig). Tools and group chat features may require additional setup.

    This section covers:
      - Basic installation (pip)
      - Installing optional dependencies for extended features
      - Post-installation verification
      - Environment variable setup for LLMs and toolkits

  examples:
    - title: "Basic Installation"
      description: "Install the core package using pip."
      code: |
        pip install autogen

    - title: "Installing with Optional Dependencies"
      description: |
        To use advanced features (e.g., group chat orchestration, interoperability with LangChain, or advanced toolkits), install the package with extras:
      code: |
        pip install autogen[group,langchain,toolkit]
        # or install all extras:
        pip install autogen[all]

    - title: "Verifying Installation"
      description: "Import the core abstractions and run a test agent."
      code: |
        python -c "from autogen import ConversableAgent; print('Install OK')"
        # Or, minimal agent test:
        from autogen import ConversableAgent
        agent = ConversableAgent(name="test_agent", system_message="Hello!", llm_config=None)
        print(agent.name)

    - title: "Setting Up LLM Provider Access"
      description: |
        Set environment variables (e.g., API keys) for your preferred LLM provider, then load them using LLMConfig.
      code: |
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
        # In Python:
        from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig
        config = LLMConfig.from_json(env="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")
        agent = ConversableAgent("assistant", llm_config=config)

    - title: "Installing Development Version"
      description: |
        For the latest updates or to contribute, clone and install from source.
      code: |
        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git
        cd autogen
        pip install -e ".[dev,all]"

  best_practices:
    - "Always use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies."
    - "Install only the extras you need to reduce dependency bloat."
    - "Verify installation with a minimal import or test agent."
    - "Set LLM API keys and config via environment variables, not hardcoded in scripts."
    - "Upgrade regularly to receive bug fixes and new features: pip install --upgrade autogen"
    - "Consult the official documentation for provider-specific setup (e.g., OpenAI, Azure, Gemini)."
