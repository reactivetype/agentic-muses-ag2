  overview: |
    The architecture of the system is built around a set of extensible abstractions for agentic communication, tool management, and orchestration. This modular design enables flexible interaction between agents (human or AI), integration of callable tools, support for multi-agent group conversations, and seamless interoperability with various LLM providers and external tool ecosystems.

  explanation: |
    The system's architecture centers on the concept of "agents"â€”autonomous entities capable of sending and receiving messages, executing tools, and participating in simple or complex group conversations. Agents are implemented through the `ConversableAgent` abstraction, which defines the fundamental agent interface and lifecycle. This is complemented by protocols that formalize agent behaviors, including tool usage and specialized communication patterns.

    Tools and toolkits encapsulate callable functions that agents can propose or execute, leveraging function-calling LLMs and human inputs. The toolkit abstraction allows for easy grouping and management of related tools.

    For orchestrating multi-agent exchanges, the framework introduces group chat and management patterns. These abstractions structure group conversations, control agent turn-taking, and support sophisticated handoff and transition logic.

    LLM configuration is standardized via the `LLMConfig` and `LLMConfigEntry` system, providing robust management of model/provider settings, environment integration, and runtime context control.

    Finally, the architecture supports tool interoperability, enabling the use of tools from other ecosystems (such as LangChain or CrewAI) by converting them into the framework's native Tool abstraction.

            name="assistant",
            system_message="You are a helpful AI.",

        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            return a + b

        result = agent.initiate_chat(other_agent, message="Hello!")

    - title: "Defining and Registering a Toolkit"
      description: "Use the @tool decorator and a Toolkit to organize multiple tools and make them available to an agent."
      code: |
        from autogen.tools import tool, Toolkit

        @tool(name="add", description="Add two numbers")
        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            return a + b

        @tool(name="subtract", description="Subtract two numbers")
        def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            return a - b

        toolkit = Toolkit([add, subtract])
        toolkit.register_for_llm(agent)

    - title: "Setting Up a Group Chat with Orchestration Pattern"
      description: "Create a group chat with multiple agents and a round-robin orchestration pattern."
      code: |
        from autogen import GroupChat, GroupChatManager, ConversableAgent
        from autogen.agentchat.group.patterns.round_robin import RoundRobinPattern

        agents = [ConversableAgent("alice"), ConversableAgent("bob")]
        pattern = RoundRobinPattern(agents=agents)
        groupchat, manager = pattern.prepare_group_chat(max_rounds=5, messages=[{"content": "Start chat"}])

        agents[0].initiate_chat(manager, message="Hello group!")

    - title: "Configuring an LLM Provider"
      description: "Set up an agent with a provider-specific LLM configuration."
      code: |
        from autogen.oai.client import OpenAILLMConfigEntry
        from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig
        from autogen import ConversableAgent

        entry = OpenAILLMConfigEntry(model="gpt-4", api_key="sk-...")
        config = LLMConfig([entry])
        agent = ConversableAgent("assistant", llm_config=config)

    - title: "Interoperating with External Tool Ecosystems"
      description: "Convert a LangChain tool into a native Tool and register it with an agent."
      code: |
        from autogen.tools.interop import Interoperability
        from langchain.tools import BaseTool

        lc_tool = BaseTool(...)
        native_tool = Interoperability.convert_tool(lc_tool)
        agent.register_tool(native_tool)

  best_practices:
    - "Assign a unique name to every agent to prevent clashes in multi-agent scenarios."
    - "Register all tools and toolkits before starting conversations to guarantee their availability."
    - "Prefer the @tool decorator for defining tools, and use accurate descriptions and type hints."
    - "Use orchestration patterns (e.g., AutoPattern, RoundRobinPattern) to manage group chat logic instead of manual agent control."
    - "Manage agent and group chat history thoughtfully to avoid unnecessary memory consumption."
    - "Utilize LLMConfig context management (with LLMConfig.current(...)) for temporary or global model configuration changes."
    - "When interoperating with external tools, always use provided converters and registries to ensure compatibility."
    - "Avoid hardcoding secrets; use environment variables or secure configuration."
