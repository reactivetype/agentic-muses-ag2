  overview: |
    Utilities and helpers are general-purpose functions and classes that support testing, debugging, and day-to-day development with the agent framework. They abstract common patterns, simplify repetitive tasks, and provide robust scaffolding for working with agents, tools, group chats, LLM configurations, and tool interoperability. These utilities are essential for both internal framework development and user applications, enabling rapid prototyping, easier testability, and improved code clarity.

  explanation: |
    The agent framework includes a rich set of utility and helper functions distributed across its submodules. These utilities serve several purposes:

    - **Testing and Mocking**: Provide mock agents, fake toolkits, and test harnesses to simulate LLM responses or agent conversations, making it easy to validate logic without connecting to live models.
    - **Serialization and Inspection**: Offer functions to serialize/deserialize agents, tools, and configurations to/from JSON, and inspect or summarize their state for debugging or logging.
    - **Tool and Agent Management**: Simplify registration, deregistration, and lookup of tools and agents, ensuring consistent interfaces and reducing boilerplate.
    - **Pattern Utilities**: Support creation and management of group chat patterns, including speaker selection utilities, transition helpers, and group orchestration scaffolding.
    - **Configuration Helpers**: Enable environment-based loading, filtering, and context management of LLM configurations, making it easy to switch between providers or model setups.
    - **Interoperability Adapters**: Convert tools and agents from external ecosystems into native framework abstractions through registry and conversion utilities.

    These helpers are often used directly in notebooks, unit tests, or as part of higher-level abstractions, and are crucial for writing maintainable, testable, and extensible agent applications.

      description: "Create a fake agent and tool to simulate interactions without real LLM calls."
      code: |
        from autogen.testing import MockConversableAgent, mock_tool

        agent = MockConversableAgent(name="mock_assistant")
        add_tool = mock_tool("add", lambda a, b: a + b, description="Add numbers")
        agent.register_tool(add_tool)

        # Simulate a chat
        reply = agent.generate_reply("What is 2 + 3?", tools=[add_tool])
        print(reply)
    - title: "Serializing and Deserializing Configurations"
      description: "Serialize an LLMConfig to JSON and load it back for reproducible tests."
      code: |
        from autogen.llm_config import LLMConfig

        config = LLMConfig.from_env("OAI_CONFIG_LIST")
        json_str = config.to_json()
        config2 = LLMConfig.from_json(json_str)
    - title: "Tool Lookup and Registration Helpers"
      description: "Dynamically register and find tools for an agent."
      code: |
        from autogen.tools import tool, find_tool_by_name

        @tool(name="greet", description="Greets the user")
        def greet(name: str) -> str:
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

        agent.register_tool(greet)
        found_tool = find_tool_by_name(agent.tools, "greet")
        print(found_tool.description)
    - title: "Group Pattern Utilities"
      description: "Using a utility to set up a round-robin speaker selection for group chat."
      code: |
        from autogen.agentchat.group.utils import round_robin_selector

        # Given a GroupChat and agent list
        next_speaker = round_robin_selector(last_speaker, groupchat)
    - title: "Interoperability Conversion"
      description: "Convert a LangChain tool to a native Tool using a utility."
      code: |
        from autogen.interop import convert_tool_from_langchain

        lc_tool = ...  # Some LangChain tool instance
        ag_tool = convert_tool_from_langchain(lc_tool)

  best_practices:
    - "Isolate utility usage in tests and prototyping code to avoid accidental production dependencies."
    - "Use provided registration and lookup helpers instead of manipulating internal agent/tool dictionaries directly."
    - "Prefer serialization utilities for saving/loading configurations and states to ensure compatibility across framework versions."
    - "Leverage mocking and fake agents for offline testing and CI pipelines."
    - "Utilize pattern and orchestration helpers for group chat logic rather than reinventing orchestration mechanisms."
