# Patterns for Orchestration (Auto, Manual, RoundRobin, Random)

## Overview

Agent orchestration patterns define how control is passed between multiple agents in a group chat or collaborative task. Selecting the right orchestration pattern is crucial for optimizing workflow, ensuring smooth transitions, and enhancing user experience. This chapter explores four primary orchestration patterns—Auto, Manual, RoundRobin, and Random—detailing their use cases, configuration, and best practices.

**Prerequisites:**  
Before proceeding, ensure you are familiar with [LLM Configuration and Model Clients](#) and have a basic setup for multiple agents within your environment.

## Explanation

### 1. Auto Orchestration

**Auto orchestration** delegates control to the system, which automatically selects the next speaking agent based on predefined triggers, agent capabilities, or conversation context.

- **Use Cases:** When you want minimal intervention for agent transitions.
- **How it Works:** The system determines which agent should respond next, often based on message content or agent roles.

### 2. Manual Orchestration

**Manual orchestration** gives explicit control to the user or a supervisor to select which agent should speak or act next.

- **Use Cases:** Human-in-the-loop workflows, demos, or complex collaborative environments.
- **How it Works:** The user selects the next speaker via UI or API, allowing for precise control.

### 3. RoundRobin Orchestration

**RoundRobin orchestration** cycles through agents in a fixed, repeating order, ensuring equal participation and load distribution.

- **Use Cases:** Group brainstorming, panel discussions, or any scenario requiring fair turn-taking.
- **How it Works:** Each agent gets a turn in sequence, regardless of context.

### 4. Random Orchestration

**Random orchestration** selects the next agent randomly from the available pool, introducing unpredictability.

- **Use Cases:** Games, creative tasks, or when randomization is desired to avoid bias.
- **How it Works:** The system randomly picks the next agent after each turn.

#### Additional Concepts

- **Speaker Selection:** The process or logic used to pick the next speaking agent.
- **Agent Transitions:** The handoff or switch from one agent to another.
- **Handoff & After Work Transitions:** Explicitly transferring control, often with transition actions or cleanup steps.

## Examples

Below are practical examples for each orchestration pattern. These assume a generic agent orchestration framework.

### 1. Auto Orchestration

```python
group = AgentGroup(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    orchestration_pattern='auto'
)
group.start_chat()
# The system determines which agent responds based on context.
```

### 2. Manual Orchestration

```python
group = AgentGroup(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    orchestration_pattern='manual'
)
group.start_chat()
group.select_next_speaker(agent2)
# User explicitly selects agent2 to respond next.
```

### 3. RoundRobin Orchestration

```python
group = AgentGroup(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    orchestration_pattern='roundrobin'
)
group.start_chat()
# Agents will speak in the order: agent1 -> agent2 -> agent3 -> agent1 -> ...
```

### 4. Random Orchestration

```python
group = AgentGroup(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    orchestration_pattern='random'
)
group.start_chat()
# The next agent is chosen at random from the list for each turn.
```

#### Customizing Speaker Selection & Agent Transitions

```python
def custom_handoff(from_agent, to_agent):
    print(f"Handoff: {from_agent.name} -> {to_agent.name}")
    # Add any cleanup or preparation logic here

group = AgentGroup(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    orchestration_pattern='manual',
    on_handoff=custom_handoff
)
```

## Best Practices

- **Choose the right pattern:** Align orchestration with your workflow needs (e.g., use RoundRobin for fairness, Auto for efficiency).
- **Customize transitions:** Implement handoff and after work hooks for logging, context passing, or resource management.
- **Monitor agent performance:** In Auto mode, ensure agents are not starved or overloaded.
- **Handle edge cases:** What if an agent is unavailable? Provide fallback mechanisms.
- **Test with real scenarios:** Simulate expected and unexpected transitions to ensure robustness.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Relying solely on Auto without understanding its decision logic.
- Neglecting user experience in Manual mode (e.g., not providing a clear UI for speaker selection).
- Forgetting to reset agent state in After Work transitions.
- Overusing Random orchestration where fairness or predictability is needed.

Experiment with different orchestration patterns in your own agent group, and observe how transitions affect conversation flow and agent collaboration.
