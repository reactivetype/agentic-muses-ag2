# AG2 v0.9 Release: Introducing the New Group Chat

## TL;DR
- AG2 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ag2/0.9/" target="_blank">`v0.9`</a> unifies the previous Group Chat and Swarm into a single, powerful, new Group Chat
- This unification provides improved flexibility, control, and better foundations for scalability
- Features include pre-built orchestration patterns, enhanced workflow control, and robust context variables
- Includes all capabilities of the previous Group Chat and Swarm
- Swarm is now deprecated but still available. We recommend migrating to the new Group Chat pattern

We're excited to announce the release of AG2 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ag2/0.9/" target="_blank">`v0.9`</a>, featuring a significant enhancement to multi-agent orchestration. This release brings together our widely used Group Chat and Swarm pattern into a unified, more powerful Group Chat that combines the best aspects of both approaches.

## A New Era for Multi-Agent Orchestration

AG2 has always provided multiple ways to coordinate agents, from simple two-agent conversations to more complex multi-agent orchestration. With <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ag2/0.9/" target="_blank">`v0.9`</a>, we've completely reimagined agent orchestration by merging these approaches into a single, unified Group Chat architecture designed to be **extensible**, **controllable**, and **scalable**.

## Why We Made This Change

Before diving into the details, let's understand why this unification matters:

- **Simplified API** - One coherent way to orchestrate multi-agent workflows
- **Enhanced Flexibility** - Structured handoffs from Swarm with more diverse hand off targets
- **Improved State Management** - More robust context sharing and state tracking across agents
- **Future-proof Design** - A foundation that can grow with evolving multi-agent orchestration needs

## Key Features of the New Group Chat

### Pre-built Patterns for Different Needs

The new Group Chat implements several orchestration patterns to suit different use cases:

- **[AutoPattern](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/patterns/#autopattern-llm-powered-speaker-selection)**: Uses an LLM to intelligently select the next speaker based on conversation context
- **[RoundRobinPattern](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/patterns/#roundrobinpattern-sequential-speaker-rotation)**: Creates a sequential rotation where agents speak in a predefined order
- **[RandomPattern](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/patterns/#randompattern-non-deterministic-speaker-selection)**: Randomly selects the next agent to speak (excluding the current speaker)
- **[ManualPattern](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/patterns/#manualpattern-human-directed-speaker-selection)**: Puts humans in control by allowing manual selection of the next speaker
- **[DefaultPattern](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/patterns/#defaultpattern-explicit-handoff-control)**: Provides complete control of transitions

### Dynamic Workflow Control with Handoffs

The handoff system has been enhanced to provide powerful control over agent transitions:

- **[LLM-based conditions](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/handoffs/#llm-based-conditions)**: Use the LLM to determine when to transfer control based on message content

```python
# Define LLM-based handoffs
customer_service.handoffs.add_llm_conditions([
    OnCondition(
        target=AgentTarget(billing_specialist),
        condition=StringLLMCondition(prompt="When the query is about billing or payments."),
        available=AvailableContextExpression(expression=ContextExpression("${account_status} == 'active'")) # PLEASE CHECK
    )
])
```

- **[Context-based conditions](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/handoffs/#context-based-conditions)**: Use shared context variables to make transition decisions

```python
# Define context-based handoffs
# This will route to the escalation agent when the issue priority is high
support_agent.handoffs.add_context_condition(
    OnContextCondition(
        target=AgentTarget(agent=escalation_agent),
        condition=ExpressionContextCondition(
            expression=ContextExpression("${issue_priority} == 'high'")
        )
    )
)

# This will route to a supervisor when retry count exceeds 3
support_agent.handoffs.add_context_condition(
    OnContextCondition(
        target=AgentTarget(agent=supervisor_agent),
        condition=ExpressionContextCondition(
            expression=ContextExpression("${retry_count} > 3")
        )
    )
)
```

- **[After-work behavior](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/handoffs/#after-work-behavior)**: Define default behavior for when an agent completes its work

```python
# Define what happens after an agent completes its work
billing_specialist.handoffs.set_after_work(RevertToUserTarget())
```

### Enhanced Transition Targets

The new Group Chat pattern introduces powerful "[Transition Targets](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/handoffs/#transition-targets)" - which define where control should go after an agent completes its work. This system goes beyond simply transferring to another agent:

- **AgentTarget/AgentNameTarget**: Transfer to a specific agent directly or by name
- **RevertToUserTarget**: Return control to the human user
- **TerminateTarget**: End the conversation entirely
- **StayTarget**: Keep control with the current agent
- **RandomAgentTarget**: Randomly select from a list of possible agents
- **AskUserTarget**: You decide who the next agent is
- **NestedChatTarget**: Transfer to a nested conversation
- **GroupChatTarget**: Transfer to a new group chat (nested group chats!)
- **GroupManagerTarget**: Transfer to the group chat manager who will select the next speaker

This flexible targeting system enables complex workflows where control might need to move between different levels of conversation or to specialized processes.

### Shared Context Management

The new `ContextVariables` class provides a structured way to share and maintain state across agents. This shared memory enables agents to:

- Maintain consistent information throughout a conversation
- Make decisions based on the current state
- Pass structured data between agents
- Control workflow based on context values

Here's how you can create and use context variables:

```python
# Initialize context variables
context = ContextVariables(data={
    "customer_id": "C12345",
    "subscription_tier": "premium",
    "support_history": []
})

# Update context in a tool function
def log_customer_interaction(
    issue_type: str,
    resolution: str,
    context_variables: ContextVariables
) -> ReplyResult:
    """Log a customer interaction in the context."""

    # Add this interaction to history
    support_history = context_variables.get("support_history", [])
    support_history.append({
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "issue_type": issue_type,
        "resolution": resolution
    })

    context_variables["support_history"] = support_history
    context_variables["last_issue_type"] = issue_type

    return ReplyResult(
        message="Interaction logged successfully",
        # Passing it into ReplyResult updates the shared context
        context_variables=context_variables
    )
```

## Getting Started with the New Group Chat

Let's explore a practical example of how the new Group Chat pattern can transform travel planning workflows. We'll implement a personalized travel itinerary system where specialized agents collaborate to assist users based on their membership status.

### The Use Case

In this scenario, we want to create a travel planning system that:

- Verifies user membership and collects travel information
- Routes users to different advisors based on membership status
- Provides personalized itineraries using customer preferences
- Facilitates collaboration between advisors and destination specialists
- Tracks itinerary status from proposal to approval

### Implementing the workflow with the new GroupChat

Now, let's implement this system:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig
from autogen.agentchat import initiate_group_chat
from autogen.agentchat.group.patterns import DefaultPattern
from autogen.agentchat.group import (
    ReplyResult,
    AgentTarget,
    AgentNameTarget,
    ContextVariables,
    RevertToUserTarget,
    OnCondition,
    StringLLMCondition,
    TerminateTarget
)

### Running This Example

To run this example yourself:

1. **Save the code** to a file (e.g., `customer_service_demo.py`)

2. **Set up your OpenAI API key** - This example uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model from OpenAI:

    === "macOS / Linux"

        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```bash
        set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
        ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install ag2[openai]
   ```

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python customer_service_demo.py
   ```

    !!! note
        This example uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model. If you want to use a different provider, ensure you:

            - Install the appropriate AG2 extra (e.g., `pip install ag2[anthropic]` for Claude models)
            - Update the `LLMConfig` to use your preferred provider and model
            - Set the appropriate environment variables for authentication with your chosen provider

        You can find the supported model provides [here](/docs/user-guide/models/amazon-bedrock)

## Migrating from Swarm to the New Group Chat

If you're currently using Swarm, we strongly recommend migrating to the new Group Chat pattern. While Swarm functionality is still available in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ag2/0.9/" target="_blank">`v0.9`</a>, it's now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

At a high level, the migration process involves:

1. **Updating imports** to use the new group chat modules instead of swarm modules
2. **Converting context variables** from dictionary-based to the new `ContextVariables` class
3. **Replacing SwarmResult with ReplyResult** in your agent functions
4. **Updating handoff definitions** to use the new agent-based handoff system
5. **Using patterns** to configure and initiate group chats

For detailed migration instructions and examples, please refer to our [Migration Guide](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/swarm/deprecation).


## Towards Scalable Agent Orchestration

This unified architecture represents the first step toward more scalable agent orchestration by building upon a serializable framework of classes. Additionally, base classes for Targets and Patterns have been designed to allow you to create your own targets and patterns.

## Get Started Today!

The new Group Chat pattern is available now in AG2 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ag2/0.9/" target="_blank">`v0.9`</a> and we encourage all users to explore it and build their own multi-agent applications.

To learn more, check out our documentation:

- [Group Chat Overview](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/orchestrations)
- [Swarm Migration Guide](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/swarm/deprecation)

We're excited to see what you build with this powerful new framework!
