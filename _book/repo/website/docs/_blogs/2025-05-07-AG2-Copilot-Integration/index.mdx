## Why This Integration Matters for Developers

Building applications with intuitive interfaces that connect to AI backends presents several practical challenges:

1. **Interface Development**: Creating intuitive interfaces for users to interact with LLM-powered backends requires building custom components for various functionalitiesâ€”chat interfaces, approval workflows, login forms, and UI elements that dynamically respond to LLM outputs. Developing these components is time-consuming and difficult to maintain.
2. **Backend Integration**: Connecting React applications to LLM powered backends typically requires custom API development and complex state management, especially when handling streaming responses or maintaining conversation context.
3. **Protocol Standardization**: Without a common protocol, developers must build custom solutions for message passing between frontend and backend, often resulting in brittle implementations.
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: As AI technologies evolve, maintaining compatibility between frontend and backend components requires ongoing developer attention.

By communicating over a <a href="https://docs.agentwire.io/introduction" target="_blank">common protocol</a> and leveraging <a href="https://docs.copilotkit.ai/guides/custom-look-and-feel/built-in-ui-components" target="_blank">CopilotKitâ€™s out-of-the-box components</a>, developers can integrate AI capabilities into existing applications or create new ones in hours rather than weeks or months.

## AG2-CopilotKit Integration in Action

Letâ€™s see how this integration works by building a travel planning assistant that helps users create personalized itineraries.

### Architecture Overview: How AG2 and CopilotKit Work Together

The AG2-CopilotKit integration leverages the <a href="https://docs.agentwire.io/introduction" target="_blank">AG UI protocol</a> to standardize communication between frontend applications and AI agents.

![architecture](img/ag2-copilotkit-architecture.png)

The architecture consists of three main components:

1. **CopilotKit UI Components**: React components that provide the chat interface and other UI elements.
2. **CopilotKit Runtime**: A middleware that handles communication between the frontend and backend.
3. **AG2 Agent**: The backend agent system powered by AG2 and exposed via <a href="https://fastagency.ai/" target="_blank">FastAgency</a>.

The <a href="https://docs.agentwire.io/introduction" target='_blank'>AG UI protocol</a> creates a standardized way for these components to exchange messages, states, and actions, making integration more consistent across different frameworks and platforms.

### Starting with the Starter Kit

The easiest way to get started is with the AG2-CopilotKit starter repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2-copilotkit-starter.git
cd ag2-copilotkit-starter
```

This repository contains a complete example of an AG2-powered multi-agent system integrated with CopilotKit.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need:

- Python 3.9 or newer
- Node.js 18.18.0 or newer
- pnpm (for package management)
- OpenAI API key

### Backend Setup: AG2 Multi-Agent System

The backend is built with <a href="https://fastagency.ai/" target="_blank">FastAgency</a>, a framework that simplifies creating and deploying AG2 agents. Letâ€™s examine the key components and start with our <a href="https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2-copilotkit-starter/blob/main/agent-py/simple_workflow.py" target='_blank'>simple_workflow.py</a> file:

```python
# Initialize the workflowfrom fastagency import UI
from fastagency.adapters.awp import AWPAdapter
from fastagency.runtimes.ag2 import Workflow
wf = Workflow()
```

This code initializes an AG2 workflow that will contain your agent logic. Next, we register the workflow:

```python
# Register the workflow
@wf.register(name="simple_learning", description="A simple travel itinerary generator workflow")
def simple_workflow(ui: UI, params: dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    # Present the initial message to the user
    initial_message = ui.text_input(
        sender="Workflow",
        recipient="User",
        prompt=INITIAL_MESSAGE,
    )
    # Configure and run the agents

    # ...

    return ui.process(response)
```

This function:

- Registers our FastAgency workflow with a name and description
- Presents an initial message to the user
- Configures agents to handle the conversation
- Processes and returns the response

Finally, we expose the workflow through FastAgency and FastAPI:

```python
# Set up FastAPI with the AWP adapter
adapter = AWPAdapter(provider=wf)
app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(adapter.router)
```

This creates an endpoint that speaks the AG UI protocol, making our agent accessible to frontend applications. For more details, check the <a href="https://fastagency.ai/" target="_blank">FastAgency documentation</a>.

To start the backend, run the following commands from the root directory:

!!! note
    We recommend using a virtual environment for your project to keep your packages contained. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank">venv</a>.

!!! note
    Before running the below commands, make sure to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable. This example uses `gpt-4o-mini`, but you can replace it with any other [model](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/models/amazon-bedrock/) supported by AG2.

    ```bash
    # macOS / Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

    # Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

```bash
cd agent-py
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn simple_workflow:app --port 8008 --reload
```

### Frontend Setup: CopilotKit Integration

The frontend integration consists of three main parts:

**1. API Route Configuration** (`ui/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts`):

```tsx
import { CopilotRuntime, CustomHttpAgent } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { copilotRuntimeHandler } from "@copilotkit/runtime/nextjs";

// Connect to the AG2 backend server
const BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8008";

const agenticChatAgent = new CustomHttpAgent({
    url: `${BASE_URL}/fastagency/awp`,
});

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
	agents: {
        agenticChatAgent,
    },
});
export const { GET, POST } = copilotRuntimeHandler(runtime);
```

This code:

- Creates a connection to our AG2 backend using the AG UI protocol
- Sets up a CopilotKit runtime with our agent
- Exports handlers for `Next.js` API routes

**2. CopilotKit Provider** (`ui/app/layout.tsx`):

```tsx
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import "@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: any }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>
                <CopilotKit
                    agent="agenticChatAgent"
                    runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
                    showDevConsole={false}
                >
                    {children}
                </CopilotKit>
            </body>
        </html>
    );
}
```
This wraps our application with the CopilotKit provider, connecting it to our agent through the runtime.

**3. Chat Interface** (`ui/app/page.tsx`):

```tsx
"use client";

import { CopilotSidebar } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <main>
        <YourMainContent />
        <CopilotSidebar
            defaultOpen={true}
            labels={{
            title: "Popup Assistant",
            initial: "Hello! I'm here and ready to help.",
            }}
        />
        </main>
    );
}
```

This `CopilotSidebar` component is the key UI element that adds a chat interface powered by AG2 to your application. With just these few lines of code, you get a functional chat interface that communicates with your backend agents.

To start the frontend, run the following commands in a new terminal session:

```bash
cd ui
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

**VoilÃ !** ðŸš€. Your travel planning application is now live at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/</a>

Open this URL in your browser and you'll see a sleek sidebar with your travel planning assistant ready to help.

Try asking it to plan a trip to Paris for 5 days or request a budget-friendly itinerary to Tokyo. The agent will guide you through collecting necessary information and then generate a personalized travel plan just for you.

This is the power of AG2 and CopilotKit working togetherâ€”a sophisticated multi-agent system with a polished UI, all with minimal code!
