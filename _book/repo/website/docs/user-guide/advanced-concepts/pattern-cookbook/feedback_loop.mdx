sidebarTitle: Feedback Loop
---

The Feedback Loop Pattern creates a workflow where content progresses through repeated cycles of evaluation and improvement. Unlike linear approaches, this pattern enables continuous refinement through deliberate iterations that build upon previous work, with each cycle enhancing quality.

### Key Characteristics

![Feedback Loop Pattern](./assets/feedback_loop.jpeg)

* **Iterative Refinement**: Output from later stages feeds back to earlier stages for improvement

* **Quality Gates**: Review stages determine whether additional iterations are needed

* **Targeted Improvements**: Specific feedback guides revisions in subsequent cycles

* **Cumulative Enhancement**: Knowledge gained in each iteration informs future refinements

### Information Flow

![Feedback Loop Flow](./assets/feedback_loop_flow.jpeg)

In the Feedback Loop Pattern, information flows cyclically through specialized stages multiple times. The process begins with creation phases, followed by cycles of review and revision. These iterations continue until quality criteria are met, with context maintained throughout to ensure cohesive progression.

* **Creation → Review → Revision → Repeat**: Content cycles through these stages multiple times

* **Feedback-Driven Progress**: Each review generates actionable insights for improvement

* **State Preservation**: Context variables track document evolution across iterations

* **Quality-Based Termination**: Cycles continue until review determines no further iterations needed

### Implementation

Our implementation demonstrates the pattern through a document creation process with specialized agents handling distinct lifecycle stages. Through structured interfaces and state tracking, the system enables multiple improvement cycles while maintaining coherence and building upon previous work.

* **Specialized Agent Roles**: Six agents (Entry, Planning, Drafting, Review, Revision, Finalization) each focus on distinct tasks

* **Structured Data Exchange**: Pydantic models ensure consistent information transfer between stages

* **Context-Based Routing**: OnContextCondition handoffs direct content based on stage and iteration status

* **Reusable Expertise**: Review and Revision agents apply accumulated knowledge across multiple iterations

## Code

<Tip>
In this code example we use OpenAI's GPT-4o mini with structured outputs.

We also set the LLM parameter `parallel_tool_calls` to False so that our agents don't recommend more than one tool call at a time. This parameter may not be available with all model providers.

{"title":"Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions","content":"### Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions\n\nIn the face of a rapidly changing climate and fluctuating energy prices, it is crucial for policymakers and business leaders to recognize the paramount importance of investing in renewable energy solutions. Not only does such investment promise substantial economic benefits, it also significantly impacts our environment and drives technological innovation. Failing to prioritize these investments risks economic stagnation and exacerbates the ongoing environmental crisis. Therefore, it is imperative that we considerably increase our commitment to renewable energy initiatives.\n\n#### Economic Benefits of Renewable Energy\n\nThe transition to renewable energy sources is not just an environmental imperative; it is an economic opportunity. By investing in renewable energy, we can create millions of jobs across various sectors, from manufacturing to installation and maintenance. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people globally in 2018, and that number is expected to continue to grow as demand rises.\n\nMoreover, renewable energy sources like solar and wind have the potential to drastically reduce energy costs over time. As technology advances and production scales up, the costs associated with renewable energy generation continue to decline. A recent report from Lazard indicates that the cost of solar and wind energy has decreased by nearly 90% in the last decade. By investing in these technologies, we can provide consumers with cheaper energy solutions, thereby stimulating economic growth and increasing disposable income, which in turn can benefit other sectors of the economy.\n\n#### Environmental Impact\n\nThe environmental implications of our energy choices cannot be overstated. The burning of fossil fuels is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, significantly contributing to climate change and global warming. By investing in renewable energy, we can dramatically reduce our carbon footprint, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet. For example, moving away from coal and embracing solar and wind energy not only curtails harmful emissions but also preserves natural resources and reduces ecological destruction.\n\nMoreover, renewable energy lies at the heart of sustainable development, allowing us to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Investments in renewable technologies assist in safeguarding biodiversity, protecting ecosystems, and ensuring that natural resources are available for future use. \n\n#### Technological Innovation\n\nInvesting in renewable energy has the secondary benefit of driving technological innovation, which is crucial for future economic and environmental policies. The renewable energy sector is a hotbed for innovation, resulting in advancements that improve efficiency, storage, and grid integration. The development of smart grids, for instance, not only enhances energy distribution but also reduces waste, ensuring that energy is consumed more efficiently.\n\nFurthermore, breakthroughs in energy storage technologies, such as advanced batteries, are pivotal for the widespread adoption of renewable energy. By enabling energy to be stored and used when needed, these innovations pave the way for a more reliable and resilient energy grid. This not only benefits consumers with consistent energy but also supports economic structures that rely heavily on energy access.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, greater investment in renewable energy solutions is not merely an ethical responsibility but an economic necessity. The potential for job creation, reduction of energy costs, environmental preservation, and technological innovation presents a strong case for immediate action. Policymakers and business leaders must unite and commit to investing in renewable energy to secure a sustainable future for both the economy and the planet. The transition to renewable energy is a path towards resilience and opportunity—let us seize it while we still have the chance to make a difference. \n\nBy prioritizing renewable energy investments today, we are setting the stage for a prosperous and sustainable tomorrow.","document_type":"essay"}

Input arguments: {'title': 'Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions', 'content': '### Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we have just a decade to transform our energy systems or face catastrophic climate-related consequences. As policymakers and business leaders, it is crucial to recognize the paramount importance of investing in renewable energy solutions not only for the health of our planet but for the economic prosperity of our future. This investment promises substantial economic benefits, significantly impacts our environment, and drives technological innovation – the triad that will lead us to a sustainable future. Failing to prioritize these investments risks economic stagnation and exacerbates the ongoing environmental crisis. Therefore, it is imperative that we considerably increase our commitment to renewable energy initiatives.\n\n#### Economic Benefits of Renewable Energy\n\nThe transition to renewable energy sources is not just an environmental imperative; it is an economic opportunity. For example, Tesla’s investment in solar battery technology and wind energy has created thousands of jobs in manufacturing and installation. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people globally in 2018, and that number is expected to continue to grow as demand rises. This is not just a statistic but a clear indicator of a burgeoning market ripe for innovation, particularly in roles related to clean tech installation and maintenance.\n\nMoreover, renewable energy sources like solar and wind have the potential to drastically reduce energy costs over time. As technology advances and production scales up, the costs associated with renewable energy generation continue to decline. A recent report from Lazard indicates that the cost of solar and wind energy has decreased by nearly 90% in the last decade. This means a shift towards these technologies not only benefits the environment but also empowers consumers with cheaper energy solutions, stimulating economic growth and increasing disposable income.\n\n#### Environmental Impact\n\nThe environmental implications of our energy choices cannot be overstated. The burning of fossil fuels is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, significantly contributing to climate change and global warming. A study published in 2020 showed that wind and solar energy could reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2050, saving thousands of lives by improving air quality and mitigating health issues related to pollution. According to Dr. Jane Goodall, a prominent environmentalist, “What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.” \n\nBy investing in renewable energy, we can dramatically reduce our carbon footprint, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet. Notable examples include Denmark, where wind energy now accounts for nearly 47% of electricity consumption, resulting in a significant 42% reduction in greenhouse gases since 1990. Investments in renewable technologies assist in safeguarding biodiversity, protecting ecosystems, and ensuring that natural resources are available for future use.\n\n#### Technological Innovation\n\nInvesting in renewable energy has the secondary benefit of driving technological innovation, which is crucial for future economic and environmental policies. The renewable energy sector is a hotbed for innovation, resulting in advancements that improve efficiency, storage, and grid integration. Cutting-edge technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells with increased efficiency rates over 25% and floating wind turbines, are changing the landscape of energy generation.

### Investing in Our Future: The Case for Renewable Energy Solutions

The stakes could not be higher. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we have just a decade to transform our energy systems or face catastrophic climate-related consequences. As policymakers and business leaders, it is crucial to recognize the paramount importance of investing in renewable energy solutions not only for the health of our planet but for the economic prosperity of our future. This investment promises substantial economic benefits, significantly impacts our environment, and drives technological innovation – the triad that will lead us to a sustainable future. Failing to prioritize these investments risks economic stagnation and exacerbates the ongoing environmental crisis. Therefore, it is imperative that we considerably increase our commitment to renewable energy initiatives.

#### Economic Benefits of Renewable Energy

The transition to renewable energy sources is not just an environmental imperative; it is an economic opportunity. For example, Tesla’s investment in solar battery technology and wind energy has created thousands of jobs in manufacturing and installation. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people globally in 2018, and that number is expected to continue to grow as demand rises. This is not just a statistic but a clear indicator of a burgeoning market ripe for innovation, particularly in roles related to clean tech installation and maintenance. As states like Texas and California have shown, investing in renewables can lead to significant regional economic growth, attracting businesses and boosting local employment.

Moreover, renewable energy sources like solar and wind have the potential to drastically reduce energy costs over time. As technology advances and production scales up, the costs associated with renewable energy generation continue to decline. A recent report from Lazard indicates that the cost of solar and wind energy has decreased by nearly 90% in the last decade. This shift not only benefits the environment but also empowers consumers with cheaper energy solutions, stimulating economic growth and increasing disposable income.

#### Environmental Impact

The environmental implications of our energy choices cannot be overstated. The burning of fossil fuels is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, significantly contributing to climate change and global warming. A study published in 2020 showed that wind and solar energy could reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2050, saving thousands of lives by improving air quality and mitigating health issues related to pollution. According to Dr. Jane Goodall, a prominent environmentalist, “What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.” By investing in renewable energy, we can dramatically reduce our carbon footprint, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet. Long-term reliance on fossil fuels not only perpetuates environmental degradation but also incurs significant future costs in addressing climate-related disasters.

Notable examples include Denmark, where wind energy now accounts for nearly 47% of electricity consumption, resulting in a significant 42% reduction in greenhouse gases since 1990. Investments in renewable technologies assist in safeguarding biodiversity, protecting ecosystems, and ensuring that natural resources are available for future use.

#### Technological Innovation

Investing in renewable energy has the secondary benefit of driving technological innovation, which is crucial for future economic and environmental policies. The renewable energy sector is a hotbed for innovation, resulting in advancements that improve efficiency, storage, and grid integration. Cutting-edge technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells with increased efficiency rates over 25% and floating wind turbines, are changing the landscape of energy generation. Government policies and incentives, such as tax credits for solar installation and funding for energy research, play a pivotal role in fostering these innovations, creating a collaborative environment for growth in the sector. For instance, the U.S. government’s Solar Investment Tax Credit has spurred exponential growth in the solar market.

Furthermore, breakthroughs in energy storage technologies, such as advanced lithium-sulfur batteries, are pivotal for the widespread adoption of renewable energy. These innovations enhance energy distribution and reduce waste, ensuring that energy is consumed more efficiently. This not only benefits consumers with consistent energy but also supports economic structures that rely heavily on energy access.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, greater investment in renewable energy solutions is not merely an ethical responsibility but an economic necessity. The potential for job creation, reduction of energy costs, environmental preservation, and technological innovation presents a strong case for immediate action. Policymakers and business leaders must unite to commit to investing in renewable energy. Every dollar invested in renewables today paves the way for a prosperous, sustainable tomorrow. Suggested steps include providing incentives for renewable energy projects, supporting research into new technologies, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders. The transition to renewable energy is a path toward resilience and opportunity — let us seize it now and lead the charge toward a sustainable energy future.
