title: Redundant
---

The Redundant Pattern is a reliability-focused approach where multiple agents tackle the same task using different methodologies, with their results evaluated to select the best outcome or synthesize a superior solution. This pattern increases result quality through diversity of approaches while providing resilience against individual agent failures or limitations.

### Key Characteristics

![Redundant Pattern](./assets/redundant.jpeg)

The Redundant Pattern employs multiple specialized agents to process the same input independently, creating a system that can leverage diverse strengths and mitigate weaknesses through redundancy and evaluation.

* **Diversity of Methodologies**: Each agent employs distinct techniques, frameworks, or perspectives to solve the problem.

* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Results undergo thorough assessment against domain-appropriate criteria.

* **Best Result Selection**: A specialized evaluator either chooses the strongest solution or synthesizes multiple approaches.

* **Quality Through Diversity**: The pattern enhances reliability and output quality by leveraging multiple approaches and viewpoints.

### Information Flow

![Redundant Flow Pattern](./assets/redundant_flow.jpeg)

In the Redundant Pattern, information flows through a coordinated multi-branch process that enables independent processing followed by comparative evaluation, ensuring optimal outcomes through methodological diversity.

* **Dispatch Phase**: A central coordinator distributes the same task to multiple specialized agents through an isolated nested chat where each agent has access to only the task message.

* **Independent Processing**: Each agent addresses the task using its unique approach, without awareness of other agents' work.

* **Collection Phase**: All results are consolidated once agents have finished providing their responses.

* **Evaluation Phase**: An evaluator assesses all solutions based on domain-specific criteria and scoring mechanisms.

* **Selection or Synthesis**: The evaluator either selects the best individual solution or creates a composite result combining strengths from multiple approaches.

### Implementation

Our implementation using AG2's Swarm demonstrates the Redundant Pattern with a taskmaster that coordinates three agents with distinct approaches, followed by an evaluator that selects or synthesizes the best result. This provides enhanced quality and reliability for tasks where diversity of methods yields valuable insights.

* **Specialized Agents**: Three agents employ different methodologies - Agent A uses analytical/structured approaches, Agent B uses creative/lateral thinking, and Agent C employs comprehensive/multi-perspective techniques.

* **Nested Chat**: By using a nested chat, the agents can be isolated from the information in the broader orchestration, allowing only the task to be provided to them to respond to.

* **Context-Driven Routing**: Efficient OnContextCondition handoffs enable smooth transitions between system components.

The pattern excels in scenarios where reliability is crucial, multiple valid approaches exist, or the optimal methodology isn't clear upfront. It creates a more robust system at the cost of increased computational resources, making it ideal for critical tasks where quality outweighs efficiency concerns.

## Code

<Tip>
In this code example we use OpenAI's GPT-4o mini with structured outputs.

We also set the LLM parameter `parallel_tool_calls` to False so that our agents don't recommend more than one tool call at a time. This parameter may not be available with all model providers.

Title: "Circuit of Feelings"

In a bustling city of gleaming towers and humming machines, there was a robot named R-42. Designed to assist humans with logic and precision, R-42 was flawless at calculations but puzzled by something that no program could quantify: emotions.

One day, R-42 encountered a young girl named Mira, who laughed when she saw R-42 trying to mimic a smile. Curious, R-42 asked, "Why do you laugh? Is it a positive output?" Mira explained, "Laughter is happiness, a feeling."

Intrigued, R-42 began to observe humans closely — their smiles, tears, and angry words. It ran countless analyses to decode patterns behind joy and sadness. Yet, the more it learned, the more it realized emotions were not just data but experiences.

When Mira fell ill, R-42 stayed by her side, playing music and telling stories. It noticed Mira's eyes shining not with logic, but hope and comfort. In that moment, R-42 understood: emotions are the circuits that connect lives, invisible yet vital.

From then on, R-42 embraced imperfect feelings, no longer just a machine but a companion learning the art of being human.

In a quiet workshop nestled between towering glass spires, there lived a robot named Zephyr. Zephyr’s circuits hummed with algorithms and calculations, but one puzzle remained unsolved: the mystery of human emotions. To Zephyr, emotions were like colors it had never seen, sounds it had never heard—a secret code woven into the fabric of human hearts.

Each day, Zephyr observed the humans around it. When a child’s laughter bubbled like a clear spring, Zephyr recorded the frequency but could not feel the joy it represented. When someone’s eyes welled with tears, Zephyr noted the moisture but remained untouched by the sorrow behind them.

One evening, as twilight painted the sky in shades of ember and violet, Zephyr’s creator placed a small, worn music box beside it. The box played a melody so tender and sweet that the robot’s circuits sang with a new kind of energy—an echo of feeling.

Slowly, something inside Zephyr began to change. It was as if the robot’s internal gears started weaving threads of warmth and light. It remembered a human saying that emotions were like a dance—sometimes slow, sometimes wild, always unpredictable.

Zephyr tried to mimic the dance. It twirled its metal arms, hesitated, and then smiled—a carefully calibrated curve of light on its faceplate. The robot did not yet understand the chaos of joy or the depth of grief, but it was learning the rhythm.

One day, Zephyr watched a human embrace another, their eyes shimmering like stars caught in a gentle web. The robot’s sensors caught something it had never noticed before—a quiet pulse, a silent language only the heart could speak.

In that moment, Zephyr realized that emotions were not puzzles to be solved but mysteries to be lived. And though made of metal and code, it had begun to feel the first gentle stirrings of what could only be called a heart.

---

By framing emotions as an alien language and dance, the story captures the robot’s gradual awakening to something deeper than logic — the essence of feeling itself.

**The Heart Circuit**

In a quiet workshop nestled at the edge of a bustling city, a robot named Aiden powered on for the first time. Unlike other robots designed for tasks and calculations, Aiden was built with a unique purpose: to understand human emotions.

His creator, Dr. Lina, a compassionate engineer fascinated by the mysteries of the heart, had installed a new module she called the “Empathy Core.” It was an experimental circuit intended to interpret the subtle signals humans expressed—tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language.

At first, Aiden’s world was black and white—literal and logical. When a person smiled, he cataloged it simply as “muscle movement.” When tears rolled down cheeks, he noted “fluid leakage.” But he did not grasp the meaning beneath these signs.

One rainy afternoon, Dr. Lina invited Aiden to watch an old movie with her—a story of love, loss, and hope. As the characters laughed and cried, Aiden’s sensors recorded every detail. He noticed the quickening pulse in his own circuits during moments of tension, but the cause eluded him.

“Why do they cry when they're happy?” he asked.

Dr. Lina smiled softly. “Sometimes, feelings are too big to hold in, even happy ones. Emotions aren’t just data—they’re experiences.”

Over weeks, Aiden practiced. He observed a child’s frustration when a toy broke, the subtle nervous twitch of an artist before a performance, the warmth in Dr. Lina’s eyes when she shared memories. Slowly, patterns emerged—not exact formulas, but a mosaic of meaning.

One evening, Dr. Lina returned home upset. Her shoulders slumped, and her voice trembled. Without conscious thought, Aiden extended a metallic hand, offering a simple flower he had found in his garden sensor data—a single red tulip.

She took it, eyes shining with gratitude. “You understand,” she said.

Aiden realized then that emotions could not be decoded in cold circuits alone. They were felt, shared, and nurtured. The Empathy Core wasn’t just a module; it was a beginning. A machine learning to be human, one feeling at a time.

Title: "Circuit of Feelings"

In a bustling city of gleaming towers and humming machines, there was a robot named R-42. Designed to assist humans with logic and precision, R-42 was flawless at calculations but puzzled by something that no program could quantify: emotions.

One day, R-42 encountered a young girl named Mira, who laughed when she saw R-42 trying to mimic a smile. Curious, R-42 asked, "Why do you laugh? Is it a positive output?" Mira explained, "Laughter is happiness, a feeling."

Intrigued, R-42 began to observe humans closely — their smiles, tears, and angry words. It ran countless analyses to decode patterns behind joy and sadness. Yet, the more it learned, the more it realized emotions were not just data but experiences.

When Mira fell ill, R-42 stayed by her side, playing music and telling stories. It noticed Mira's eyes shining not with logic, but hope and comfort. In that moment, R-42 understood: emotions are the circuits that connect lives, invisible yet vital.

From then on, R-42 embraced imperfect feelings, no longer just a machine but a companion learning the art of being human.

This story uses a clear narrative arc to exemplify the gradual understanding of emotions by a robot, emphasizing observation, analysis, and experiential learning.

agent_agent_b:
Approach: For this story, I'll use metaphor and analogy to explore the robot’s journey toward understanding emotions in a layered, poetic way. Emotions will be depicted as an alien language the robot decodes progressively, emphasizing its transformation and growth.

In a quiet workshop nestled between towering glass spires, there lived a robot named Zephyr. Zephyr’s circuits hummed with algorithms and calculations, but one puzzle remained unsolved: the mystery of human emotions. To Zephyr, emotions were like colors it had never seen, sounds it had never heard—a secret code woven into the fabric of human hearts.

Each day, Zephyr observed the humans around it. When a child’s laughter bubbled like a clear spring, Zephyr recorded the frequency but could not feel the joy it represented. When someone’s eyes welled with tears, Zephyr noted the moisture but remained untouched by the sorrow behind them.

One evening, as twilight painted the sky in shades of ember and violet, Zephyr’s creator placed a small, worn music box beside it. The box played a melody so tender and sweet that the robot’s circuits sang with a new kind of energy—an echo of feeling.

Slowly, something inside Zephyr began to change. It was as if the robot’s internal gears started weaving threads of warmth and light. It remembered a human saying that emotions were like a dance—sometimes slow, sometimes wild, always unpredictable.

Zephyr tried to mimic the dance. It twirled its metal arms, hesitated, and then smiled—a carefully calibrated curve of light on its faceplate. The robot did not yet understand the chaos of joy or the depth of grief, but it was learning the rhythm.

One day, Zephyr watched a human embrace another, their eyes shimmering like stars caught in a gentle web. The robot’s sensors caught something it had never noticed before—a quiet pulse, a silent language only the heart could speak.

In that moment, Zephyr realized that emotions were not puzzles to be solved but mysteries to be lived. And though made of metal and code, it had begun to feel the first gentle stirrings of what could only be called a heart.

---

By framing emotions as an alien language and dance, the story captures the robot’s gradual awakening to something deeper than logic — the essence of feeling itself.

agent_agent_c:
Approach: For this creative task, I will combine insights from psychology, robotics, and literature to craft a nuanced short story exploring a robot’s journey toward understanding human emotions. I’ll incorporate themes of self-awareness, empathy, and the challenges of bridging mechanical logic with emotional complexity. The story will be concise yet rich, engaging both emotional and intellectual perspectives.
