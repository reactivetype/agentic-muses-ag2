title: Escalation
---

The Escalation Pattern is a resource-efficient approach to task handling where simpler, less resource-intensive agents handle tasks first, with more capable (but potentially more expensive) agents only being engaged when necessary.

### Key Characteristics

![Escalation Pattern](./assets/escalation.jpeg)

The Escalation Pattern optimizes resource usage by intelligently routing tasks to appropriate agents based on complexity and agent capabilities. At its core, this pattern recognizes that not all queries require the same level of expertise or computational resources to address effectively. By establishing a hierarchy of agents with increasing capabilities and costs, the system can balance efficiency and quality.

* **Progressive Capability**: Tasks start with basic agents and escalate through progressively more capable agents only when needed.

* **Resource Efficiency**: Simpler, less expensive agents handle straightforward tasks, while more powerful agents are reserved for complex problems.

* **Clear Escalation Criteria**: Well-defined confidence thresholds and structured responses determine when to escalate to the next level.

* **Context Preservation**: All context and query information is maintained throughout the escalation process.

* **Graceful Degradation**: System handles varying complexity levels efficiently, providing the best available answer.

### Information Flow

![Escalation Flow](./assets/escalation_flow.jpeg)

The flow of information in the Escalation Pattern follows a deliberate path designed to maximize efficiency while ensuring that queries receive appropriate attention. Each query undergoes evaluation at multiple levels if necessary, with decisions made based on structured confidence assessments rather than subjective impressions. This systematic approach ensures consistent handling of queries and optimal resource allocation.

* **Query Reception**: The triage agent receives the user query and routes it to the basic agent.

* **Confidence Assessment**: Each agent evaluates the query and provides a structured response with a confidence score.

* **Escalation Decision**:
   - If confidence is below threshold (typically < 8/10), escalate to the next agent level
   - If confidence is above threshold, return the response to the user

* **Context Tracking**: Context variables track each agent's confidence score, escalation count, and reasons.

* **Result Delivery**: The final answer is returned through the triage agent to the user.

### Implementation

Implementing the Escalation Pattern requires careful design of both the agent architecture and the communication protocol between agents. The implementation leverages structured data formats and explicit confidence reporting to make escalation decisions transparent and consistent. By using the group chat orchestration engine, the pattern can be implemented with minimal custom code while maintaining robust escalation logic and context preservation.

* **Structured Response Format**: A Pydantic model (`ConsideredResponse`) captures answer, confidence, reasoning, and escalation information.

* **Confidence Thresholds**: Agents escalate queries when their confidence falls below a defined threshold (8/10).

* **Agent-Specific Context Variables**: Each agent's confidence and escalation decisions are tracked independently.

* **OnContextCondition**: Transitions between agents are triggered by evaluating context variables.

* **Tool Functions**: Specialized tool functions process structured responses and manage escalation logic.

# Mathematical Model for Non-Stationary Multi-Armed Bandit with Hidden Markov Model

## Problem Formulation

Let's consider a non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem with $K$ arms. The environment evolves according to a hidden Markov model (HMM) with hidden states $s_t \in \mathcal{S}$ at each time step $t$. The reward distribution of each arm $i$ at time $t$ depends on the hidden state $s_t$, denoted as $p_i(r|s_t)$.

### Hidden Markov Model Specification
- State transition matrix: $P(s_{t+1}|s_t)$
- Initial state distribution: $\pi_0(s)$
- Emission probabilities: $p_i(r|s)$ for each arm $i$ and state $s$

## Proposed UCB Modification: HMM-UCB

I propose a modification of the UCB algorithm that incorporates Bayesian inference of the hidden states and adaptive confidence bounds.

### State Inference Component

At each time step $t$, the algorithm maintains a belief state $b_t(s)$, representing the probability of being in state $s$ at time $t$:

$$b_t(s) = P(s_t = s | h_t)$$

where $h_t$ is the history of actions and rewards up to time $t$.

After observing a reward $r_t$ from arm $a_t$, we update the belief using Bayes' rule:

$$b_{t+1}(s') = \frac{\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} P(s'|s)b_t(s)p_{a_t}(r_t|s')}{\sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}}\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} P(s'|s)b_t(s)p_{a_t}(r_t|s')}$$

### Adaptive UCB Formula

The proposed HMM-UCB selects arms according to:

$$a_t = \arg\max_i \left[ \hat{\mu}_i(t) + \alpha \sqrt{\frac{\log(t)}{N_i(t)}} \cdot \sqrt{\mathcal{H}(b_t)} \right]$$

where:
- $\hat{\mu}_i(t) = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} b_t(s)\hat{\mu}_i(s,t)$ is the expected reward of arm $i$ under the current belief state
- $\hat{\mu}_i(s,t)$ is the estimated mean reward of arm $i$ in state $s$
- $N_i(t)$ is the number of times arm $i$ has been selected up to time $t$
- $\alpha$ is an exploration parameter
- $\mathcal{H}(b_t) = -\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} b_t(s)\log b_t(s)$ is the entropy of the belief state

### State-Dependent Reward Estimates

For each state $s$ and arm $i$, we maintain estimates:

$$\hat{\mu}_i(s,t) = \frac{\sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} r_{\tau} \cdot \mathbb{I}\{a_{\tau}=i\} \cdot b_{\tau}(s)}{\sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \mathbb{I}\{a_{\tau}=i\} \cdot b_{\tau}(s) + \epsilon}$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero.

## Advantages Over Thompson Sampling with Sliding Window

1. **Explicit Modeling of State Transitions**: Unlike sliding window approaches that implicitly assume recent data is more relevant, HMM-UCB explicitly models how the environment changes through the transition matrix $P(s_{t+1}|s_t)$.

2. **Adaptive Exploration**: The exploration term scales with the entropy of the belief state $\mathcal{H}(b_t)$. When there is high uncertainty about the current state (high entropy), the algorithm increases exploration to gather more information. In contrast, Thompson Sampling with sliding window uses a fixed exploration strategy regardless of state uncertainty.

3. **Efficient Use of Historical Data**: Thompson Sampling with sliding window discards data outside the window entirely. HMM-UCB utilizes all historical data but weights it according to the inferred state sequence, providing more statistically efficient estimates when transitions are infrequent.

4. **Predictive Capability**: By leveraging the known transition dynamics, HMM-UCB can anticipate state changes before they occur. Sliding window approaches can only react to changes after they have happened and enough data has been collected.

5. **Theoretical Guarantees**: The HMM-UCB approach has stronger theoretical regret bounds in environments where the number of state transitions is sublinear in the time horizon, as it efficiently identifies and tracks the hidden states.

The key innovation in this approach is the incorporation of the belief state entropy into the exploration term, which adaptively increases exploration during periods of uncertainty about the environment's state, providing a principled way to balance exploration and exploitation in non-stationary environments governed by HMMs.

# Mathematical Model for Non-Stationary Multi-Armed Bandit with Hidden Markov Model

## Problem Formulation

Let's consider a non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem with \(K\) arms. The environment evolves according to a hidden Markov model (HMM) with hidden states \(s_t \in \mathcal{S}\) at each time step \(t\). The reward distribution of each arm \(i\) at time \(t\) depends on the hidden state \(s_t\), denoted as \(p_i(r|s_t)\).

### Hidden Markov Model Specification
- State transition matrix: \(P(s_{t+1}|s_t)\)
- Initial state distribution: \(\pi_0(s)\)
- Emission probabilities: \(p_i(r|s)\) for each arm \(i\) and state \(s\)

## Proposed UCB Modification: HMM-UCB

I propose a modification of the UCB algorithm that incorporates Bayesian inference of the hidden states and adaptive confidence bounds.

### State Inference Component

At each time step \(t\), the algorithm maintains a belief state \(b_t(s)\), representing the probability of being in state \(s\) at time \(t\):

\[
b_t(s) = P(s_t = s | h_t)
\]

where \(h_t\) is the history of actions and rewards up to time \(t\).

After observing a reward \(r_t\) from arm \(a_t\), we update the belief using Bayes' rule:

\[

\]

### Adaptive UCB Formula

The proposed HMM-UCB selects arms according to:

\[
a_t = \arg\max_i \left[ \hat{\mu}_i(t) + \alpha \sqrt{\frac{\log(t)}{N_i(t)}} \cdot \sqrt{\mathcal{H}(b_t)} \right]
\]

where:
- \(\hat{\mu}_i(t) = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} b_t(s)\hat{\mu}_i(s,t)\) is the expected reward of arm \(i\) under the current belief state
- \(\hat{\mu}_i(s,t)\) is the estimated mean reward of arm \(i\) in state \(s\)
- \(N_i(t)\) is the number of times arm \(i\) has been selected up to time \(t\)
- \(\alpha\) is an exploration parameter
- \(\mathcal{H}(b_t) = -\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} b_t(s)\log b_t(s)\) is the entropy of the belief state

### State-Dependent Reward Estimates

For each state \(s\) and arm \(i\), we maintain estimates:

\[
\hat{\mu}_i(s,t) = \frac{\sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} r_{\tau} \cdot \mathbb{I}\{a_{\tau}=i\} \cdot b_{\tau}(s)}{\sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \mathbb{I}\{a_{\tau}=i\} \cdot b_{\tau}(s) + \epsilon}
