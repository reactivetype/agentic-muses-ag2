---

The Triage with Tasks Pattern is a workflow orchestration approach that breaks down complex user requests into structured task sequences with specialized agents handling specific task types in a sequential order.

This pattern excels at managing interdependent work where certain tasks must precede others, such as research before writing, while maintaining organized tracking of task status, priorities, and dependencies throughout the process.

By creating a clear task taxonomy and enforcing execution order, this pattern ensures each component of a complex request is handled by the most appropriate specialist agent while preserving the logical workflow dependencies.

This pattern is used within our [`DocAgent`](/docs/user-guide/reference-agents/docagent) ([code](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/autogen/agents/experimental/document_agent/document_agent.py)).

### Key Characteristics

![Triage with Tasks Pattern](./assets/triage_tasks.jpeg)

The Triage with Tasks Pattern establishes a structured workflow where complex requests are decomposed into discrete, prioritized tasks that flow through specialized agents in a predetermined sequence.

* **Task Decomposition**: Initial triage breaks requests into categorized tasks (e.g., research, writing).

* **Sequential Task Processing**: Tasks are processed in a logical order with enforced prerequisites (e.g., research tasks must complete before dependent writing tasks begin).

* **Specialized Task Agents**: Dedicated agents handle specific task types, focusing exclusively on their domain expertise.

* **Dynamic Task Management**: A central task manager tracks progress, maintains context, and routes tasks to appropriate agents based on current state and dependencies.

### Information Flow

![Triage with Tasks Flow Pattern](./assets/triage_tasks_flow.jpeg)

The Triage with Tasks Pattern creates a structured information pipeline where tasks flow from initial triage agent through specialized processors in a determined sequence.

* **Triage Stage**: User requests are analyzed and decomposed into categorized, pre-defined, tasks.

* **Task Distribution**: Tasks flow through a central task manager that enforces the sequence, ensuring prerequisite tasks are completed before dependent ones begin.

* **Specialized Processing**: Each task is processed by a domain-specific agent that adds its expertise to the task output.

* **Consolidated Results**: Upon completion of all tasks, results are gathered and presented as a cohesive summary that reflects the relationships between the different task outputs.

### Implementation

Our implementation using AG2's Group Chat demonstrates the Triage with Tasks Pattern with a structured system that breaks user requests into research and writing tasks, ensuring research is completed before dependent writing begins, while maintaining comprehensive task tracking.

* **Structured Data Models**: Pydantic models (ResearchTask, WritingTask) define the explicit schema for different task types, ensuring consistent tracking and processing.

* **Context-Aware Task Management**: The TaskManager maintains rich context including task lists, completion status, and current task indices to ensure proper sequencing.

* **Dynamic System Messages**: Agent prompts update based on context, ensuring each agent always has current information about its assigned task.

* **Conditional Hand-offs**: [`OnContextCondition`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/group/on_context_condition/OnContextCondition/#autogen.agentchat.group.on_context_condition.OnContextCondition) transitions efficiently route tasks based on current state, ensuring research is completed before writing begins, and providing a comprehensive summary when all tasks are finished.

## Code

<Tip>
In this code example we use OpenAI's GPT-4o mini with structured outputs.

We also set the LLM parameter `parallel_tool_calls` to False so that our agents don't recommend more than one tool call at a time. This parameter may not be available with all model providers.

===== WRITING =====

1. Topic: Climate Change Solutions: Solar Panels and Wind Farms - Longer Form Article
Type: article
Details: Write a comprehensive article summarizing in-depth research on solar panels and wind farms, covering technologies, benefits, challenges, and future outlook.
Content: Introduction

Climate change is one of the most urgent global challenges today, driving a critical need for sustainable and renewable energy solutions. Among the most effective technologies addressing this challenge are solar panels and wind farms. These renewable energy sources reduce dependence on fossil fuels, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and help transition the world toward a cleaner energy future.

Solar Panels: Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, and Future Outlook

Solar panels primarily use photovoltaic (PV) technology to convert sunlight into electricity. Various types are widely used: monocrystalline for high efficiency, polycrystalline for cost-effectiveness, thin-film for flexibility, and bifacial panels that capture light from both sides. Innovations like perovskite solar cells and tandem cells—combining silicon and perovskite—are advancing the field by enhancing efficiency and lowering costs. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are emerging as aesthetically pleasing, space-saving solutions where solar cells are integrated into building materials.

The benefits of solar energy include clean, renewable electricity generation that sharply reduces carbon emissions, scalable deployment from rooftops to utility-scale farms, and low operational costs after initial investment. However, challenges remain: solar output is intermittent, dependent on weather and daylight; upfront costs can be high; large solar farms require significant land; and end-of-life panel recycling and disposal present environmental concerns.

Recent advancements address many of these challenges. Perovskite technology promises higher efficiency and affordability. Bifacial panels increase energy capture by using reflected sunlight from the environment. The integration of solar with energy storage systems helps mitigate intermittency, increasing reliability. Manufacturing innovations producing thinner, lighter, and flexible panels broaden application possibilities while reducing resource consumption.

Wind Farms: Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, and Future Outlook

Wind farms convert the kinetic energy of wind into electricity through large turbines, predominantly horizontal-axis types. Turbine sizes have grown substantially, with offshore wind farms harnessing powerful, more consistent winds. Advances in blade design, taller towers, and multi-megawatt turbines enhance energy yields and efficiency.

Wind energy provides significant environmental and economic benefits. It produces clean electricity with near-zero emissions, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and benefits from relatively low operational costs. Offshore wind farms, in particular, achieve higher capacity factors due to steady winds.

However, wind farms face challenges such as the variability of wind, land use and aesthetic impacts, noise concerns, potential harm to wildlife like birds and bats, and demands for upgraded grid infrastructure to manage intermittent energy input.

Recent technological progress includes the development of floating offshore turbines, allowing installation in deep waters previously inaccessible. Digitalization and artificial intelligence applications optimize turbine performance and maintenance scheduling. Larger turbines exceeding 10 MW capacity improve economics of scale. Additionally, hybrid systems combining wind power with energy storage or complementing renewables boost grid stability.

Future Outlook

The future of these technologies lies in their integration with energy storage, smart grids, and improved materials and designs. Investment in research, infrastructure, and policy support will be essential to overcome remaining hurdles and enhance deployment worldwide. As efficiencies improve and costs continue to decline, solar panels and wind farms will play an increasingly vital role in combating climate change.

Conclusion

Solar panels and wind farms stand as pivotal climate change solutions, offering scalable, renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. Continued innovation and expansion of these technologies promise a cleaner, more sustainable energy landscape critical for global climate stability.
