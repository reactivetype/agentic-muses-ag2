The Context-Aware Routing Pattern creates a dynamic workflow where tasks are intelligently distributed to specialized agents based on content analysis rather than predetermined paths. Unlike static patterns with fixed routes, this approach analyzes each request in real-time to determine the most appropriate specialist, ensuring queries are handled by agents with the most relevant expertise while maintaining conversation continuity even as topics shift across domains.

### Key Characteristics

![Context-Aware Routing Pattern](./assets/context_aware_routing.jpeg)

The Context-Aware Routing Pattern uses intelligent analysis to match requests with the most qualified specialist. By examining the content and context of each query, the system can dynamically adapt its routing decisions, ensuring optimal expertise allocation while maintaining a seamless user experience across domain transitions.

* **Dynamic Content Analysis**: Each request is analyzed for keywords, themes, and intent to determine the most appropriate domain for routing.

* **Adaptive Routing Logic**: Routing decisions adapt in real-time to changing topics, allowing smooth transitions between different domains of expertise.

* **Ambiguity Resolution**: When queries have unclear domain affiliations, the system can request clarification before routing.

* **Contextual Memory**: Past interactions and domain history inform future routing decisions, creating a more coherent multi-domain experience.

### Information Flow

![Context-Aware Flow](./assets/context_aware_routing_flow.jpeg)

In the Context-Aware Routing Pattern, information flows through a central router that serves as a dispatcher for incoming requests. This router analyzes each query's content and context before directing it to a specialized agent, creating a hub-and-spoke information flow that dynamically adjusts based on the nature of each request rather than following a predetermined sequence.

* **Analysis Phase**: Each request undergoes content analysis to extract domain indicators and intent.

* **Decision Point**: Based on analysis, the system determines which specialist agent has the most relevant expertise.

* **Specialization Phase**: The selected domain expert processes the request using their specialized knowledge.

* **Return Path**: Responses flow back to the user, with the router maintaining awareness of the conversation state for future routing decisions.

### Implementation

Our implementation using AG2's Group Chat demonstrates the Context-Aware Routing Pattern with a router agent that analyzes queries and directs them to specialized domain experts. The system maintains rich contextual information about domain history, request patterns, and confidence levels, enabling intelligent routing decisions that improve as the conversation evolves.

* **Content Analysis Tools**: The router agent uses sophisticated analysis functions to determine query domains and calculate confidence scores.

* **Domain Specialists**: Four specialized agents (technology, finance, healthcare, general knowledge) provide domain-specific expertise.

* **Context Variables**: Shared context tracks domain history, confidence scores, and routing decisions to inform future interactions.

* **OnContextCondition Handoffs**: Efficient conditional handoffs dynamically route requests based on the determined domain.

This pattern excels in multi-domain support systems, complex customer service environments, and research assistants that require access to diverse knowledge domains. It enables a single system to provide expert-level responses across multiple domains while maintaining a coherent conversation experience.

## Code

<Tip>
In this code example we use OpenAI's GPT-4o mini.

We also set the LLM parameter `parallel_tool_calls` to False so that our agents don't recommend more than one tool call at a time. This parameter may not be available with all model providers.

    2. Finance Specialist: For questions about money, investments, banking, budgeting, financial planning, taxes, economics, etc. Use route_to_finance_specialist to transfer.

    4. General Knowledge Specialist: For general questions that don't clearly fit the other categories or span multiple domains. Use route_to_general_specialist to transfer.

    For each query, you must:

    2. Determine the correct domain by analyzing keywords, themes, and context
    3. Consider the conversation history and previous domains if available

    - Previously discussed topics
    - User's possible follow-up patterns
    - Domain switches that might indicate changing topics

Frequent morning headaches accompanied by dizziness can have several potential causes, ranging from lifestyle factors to medical conditions. Some common causes include:

- **Sleep issues:** Poor quality sleep, sleep apnea, or insufficient sleep can trigger headaches and dizziness in the morning.
- **Dehydration:** Not drinking enough fluids can cause headaches.
- **Low blood sugar:** Skipping meals or having low blood sugar overnight may lead to morning headaches.
- **Medication side effects:** Certain medications or their withdrawal can cause headaches.
- **Tension headaches or migraines:** These can present with morning symptoms.
- **Blood pressure changes:** High or low blood pressure can cause headaches and dizziness.
- **Sinus problems or allergies:** Congestion might cause morning headaches.
- **Other medical conditions:** Such as anemia, vision problems, or neurological issues.

**Lifestyle changes and management strategies:**
- Ensure consistent, adequate, and quality sleep (7-9 hours per night) with a regular schedule.
- Stay well hydrated throughout the day.
- Avoid skipping meals and maintain balanced blood sugar levels.
- Limit caffeine and alcohol intake.
- Manage stress through relaxation techniques, exercise, or mindfulness.
- Maintain good posture and take breaks if you work at a desk or computer.

**Diet and headache reduction:**
Some foods and nutrients may help reduce headache frequency:
- Magnesium-rich foods: spinach, nuts, seeds, whole grains.
- Riboflavin (Vitamin B2): found in eggs, dairy, lean meats.
- Omega-3 fatty acids: fatty fish like salmon, flaxseeds.
- Stay consistent with meals and avoid trigger foods (such as processed meats, aged cheese, artificial sweeteners, and excessive caffeine).

Because headaches with dizziness can sometimes indicate underlying health issues, especially if frequent or worsening, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment. They may recommend investigations or specific therapies if needed.

You asked about frequent morning headaches with dizziness, possible causes, lifestyle changes, treatments, and specific foods to help reduce headache frequency. The potential causes include sleep issues, dehydration, low blood sugar, medication effects, tension headaches or migraines, blood pressure changes, sinus problems, or other medical conditions. Lifestyle changes to consider are improving sleep quality and regularity, staying hydrated, avoiding meal skipping, limiting caffeine and alcohol, managing stress, and maintaining good posture. Foods that may help include magnesium-rich foods (spinach, nuts, seeds), riboflavin sources (eggs, dairy, lean meats), and omega-3 fatty acids (fatty fish, flaxseeds), while avoiding known trigger foods is also advised. Because these symptoms might indicate underlying health issues, seeing a healthcare provider for diagnosis and personalized advice is important, especially if symptoms worsen or are accompanied by other concerning signs. If you need more detailed guidance or have other questions, feel free to ask!
