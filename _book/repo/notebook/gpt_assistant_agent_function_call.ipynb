    "# From Dad Jokes To Sad Jokes: Function Calling with GPTAssistantAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "Autogen allows `GPTAssistantAgent` to be augmented with \"tools\" — pre-defined functions or capabilities — that extend its ability to handle specific tasks, similar to how one might natively utilize tools in the [OpenAI Assistant's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we create a basic Multi-Agent System using Autogen's `GPTAssistantAgent` to convert Dad jokes on a specific topic into Sad jokes. It consists of a \"Dad\" agent which has the ability to search the [Dad Joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) and a \"Sad Joker\" agent which converts the Dad jokes into Sad jokes. The Sad Joker then writes the sad jokes into a txt file.\n",
