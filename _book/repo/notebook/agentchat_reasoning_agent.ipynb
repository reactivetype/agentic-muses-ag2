    "# ReasoningAgent - Advanced LLM Reasoning with Multiple Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` is designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities through systematic exploration of thought processes. By implementing the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, it enables LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama to break down complex problems into manageable steps and explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the key features and capabilities of the `ReasoningAgent`, showing how it can effectively reason about problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` supports multiple search strategies for exploring the reasoning space:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Beam Search (Default)\n",
    "- Maintains the top `k` most promising paths at each step\n",
    "- Efficient for problems with clear evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Configurable beam width to balance exploration vs computation\n",
    "- Special case: DFS mode (beam size = 1) for linear reasoning similar to Chain-of-Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "- Balances exploration and exploitation using UCT formula\n",
    "- Particularly effective for problems with delayed rewards\n",
    "- Stochastic exploration helps avoid local optima\n",
    "- Configurable number of simulations and exploration constant\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)\n",
    "- Provides immediate reflection feedback before the next simulation\n",
    "- Helps identify poor reasoning paths early for future improvement\n",
    "- Especially useful for complex multi-step reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thinker Agent**: Generates potential next steps in the reasoning process\n",
    "2. **Grader Agent**: Evaluates the quality of each reasoning step\n",
    "3. **Interim Execution**: Option to execute the selected steps, enabling stepwise reasoning.\n",
    "4. **Code Execution**: a child user agent will execute code automatically during reasoning\n",
    "5. **Tree Structure**: Organizes thoughts hierarchically for systematic exploration\n",
    "6. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in Graphviz support for analyzing reasoning paths\n",
    "7. **Logging Features**: Log and save thinking trajectories to finetune the language model\n",
    "8. **Configuration Options**: The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary"

By setting `beam_size` greater than 1, the agent can maintain several candidate solutions at each step, evaluating them based on their potential to lead to the best final answer. This method is particularly effective when the solution space is large and complex, as it balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that promising paths are prioritized while still considering alternative options.\n",

    "### Beam Search with Batch Grading\n",
    "By default, node grading is performed one at a time. While this approach is often sufficient, certain applications benefit from a batched grading approach on each beam expansion. In other words, instead of grading all nodes across the entire search in a single pass, we group each beam's newly expanded nodes into a single batch for grading. This yields:\n",
